retail molsons products. yukon northwest territories and nunavat manage distribution and retail through government liquor commissioners. manufacturing production and packaging brewing raw materials molsons goal is to procure highest quality materials and services at the lowest prices available. molson selects global suppliers for materials and services that best meet this goal. molson also uses hedging instruments to protect from volatility in the commodities and foreign exchange markets. molson sources barley malt from two primary providers with commitments through . hops are purchased from a variety of global suppliers in the u.s. europe and new zealand with commitments through . other starch brewing adjuncts are sourced from two main suppliers both in north america. we do not foresee any significant risk of disruption in the supply of these agricultural products. molson and cbc in the u.s. have benefited from mergerdriven cost synergies related to the acquisition of certain brewing materials. water used in the brewing process is from local sources in the communities where our breweries operate. brewing and packaging facilities molson has six breweries strategically located throughout canada which brew bottle package market and distribute all owned and licensed brands sold in and exported from canada. the breweries are as follows montral qubec toronto ontario vancouver british columbia edmonton alberta st. johns newfoundland and creemore ontario. the montral and toronto breweries account for approximately threefourths of the companys canada production. the moncton new brunswick brewery is under construction with plans to be complete by september . packaging materials glass bottles molson single sources glass bottles and has a committed supply through . availability of glass bottles has not been an issue and molson does not expect any difficulties in accessing them. however the risk of glass bottle supply disruptions has increased with the reduction of local supply alternatives due to the consolidation of the glass bottle industry in north america. the distribution systems in each province generally provide the collection network for returnable bottles. the standard container for beer brewed in canada is the ml returnable bottle which represents approximately of domestic sales in canada. in october the canadian competition bureau began a review into the validity of industry arrangements regarding industry bottle standards. the bureau has recently advised that they have discontinued their review. the industry arrangements remain in place. aluminum cans molson single sources aluminum cans and has a committed supply through . availability of aluminum cans has not been an issue and molson does not expect any difficulties in

and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. molson does not foresee difficulties in accessing these products in the near future. seasonality of business total industry volume in canada is sensitive to factors such as weather changes in demographics and consumer preferences. consumption of beer in canada is also seasonal with approximately of industry sales volume occurring during the four months from may through august. competitive conditions canada beer industry overview since the premium beer category in canada has gradually lost volume to the super premium and value below premium categories. the growth of the value category slowed in and and the price gap between premium and value brands was relatively stable although the number of value brands increased. in we increased regular selling prices for our premium brands in select markets but used targeted feature price activity to generate growth. the canadian brewing industry is a mature market. it is characterized by aggressive competition for volume and market share from regional brewers microbrewers and certain foreign brewers as well as molsons main domestic competitor. these competitive pressures require significant annual investment in marketing and selling activities. there are three major beer segments based on price super premium which includes imports premium which includes the majority of domestic brands and the light subsegment and value. during estimated industry sales volume in canada including sales of imported beers increased by approximately on a yearoveryear basis. our competitive position the canada brewing industry is comprised principally of two major brewers molson and labatt whose combined market share is approximately of beer sold in canada. the ontario and qubec markets account for approximately of the total beer market in canada. our malt beverages also compete with other alcohol beverages including wine and spirits and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years resulting in a reduction in the beer segments lead in the overall alcoholic beverages market. united states segment coors brewing company is the thirdlargest brewer by volume in the united states with an approximate market share. cbc produces markets and sells the coors portfolio of brands in the united states and its territories and includes the results of the rocky mountain metal corporation rmmc and rocky mountain bottle corporation rmbc joint ventures. the u.s. segment also includes coors brand volume primarily coors light that is sold outside of the united states and its territories primarily mexico and the caribbean as well as sales of molson brand products in the united states. sales and distribution in the united states beer is generally distributed through a threetier system consisting of manufacturers distributors and retailers. a national network of approximately independent distributors purchases our products and distributes them to retail accounts. we estimate that approximately onefourth of our product is sold onpremise in bars and restaurants and the other threefourths is sold offpremise in liquor stores convenience stores grocery stores and other retail outlets. we also own three distributorships which collectively handled approximately of our total u.s. segments volume in . approximately of our volume passes through one of our satellite redistribution centers throughout the united states prior to being sold to distributors. in puerto rico we market and sell coors light through an independent distributor. coors light is the leading beer brand in puerto rico. sales in puerto rico represented less than of our u.s. sales volume in . we also sell our products in several other caribbean markets. cerveceria cuauhtemoc moctezuma s.a. de c.v. a subsidiary of femsa cerveza is the sole and exclusive importer marketer seller and distributor of coors light in mexico. manufacturing production and packaging in the united states brewing raw materials we use the highestquality water barley and hops to brew our products. we malt of our production requirements using barley purchased under yearly contracts from a network of independent farmers located in five regions in the western united states. hops and starches are purchased from suppliers primarily in the united states. we have acquired water rights to provide for longterm strategic growth and to sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought in colorado. cbc also uses hedging instruments to protect from volatility in the commodities and foreign exchange markets. brewing and packaging facilities we have two production facilities in the united states. we own and operate the worlds largest singlesite brewery located in golden colorado. we also operate a packaging facility located in the shenandoah valley in virginia. in order to supply our markets in the eastern united states more efficiently we are adding brewing capability to our virginia facility which we expect to have operational by summer of . the golden brewery has the capacity to brew and package more than million barrels annually. the shenandoah brewery will have a production capacity of approximately million barrels. the shenandoah facility will source its barley malt from the golden malting facility. we closed our memphis brewing and packaging facility in september and shifted its production to other mcbc facilities. all products shipped to puerto rico or otherwise exported outside the u.s. are now packaged at the shenandoah facility and upon its full buildout all puerto rico and export volume will be brewed in shenandoah. the u.s. segment imports molson products and a portion of another u.s. brand volume from molsons montral brewery. cbc faces cost challenges due to the concentration of its brewing activities at few locations compared with our other operating segments and compared with our competitors in the united states who operate more breweries in geographically diverse locations in the u.s. these cost challenges have been exacerbated by increases in diesel fuel costs in recent years. the shenandoah brewery in part is an effort to address these challenges. packaging materials aluminum cans approximately of our u.s. products were packaged in aluminum cans in . we purchased approximately of those cans from rmmc our joint venture with ball corporation ball whose production facility is located adjacent to the brewery in golden colorado. in addition to our supply agreement with rmmc we also have a commercial supply agreement with ball to purchase cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through rmmc. aluminum is an exchange traded commodity and its price can be volatile. the rmmc joint venture agreement is scheduled to expire in . glass bottles we packaged approximately of our u.s. products in in glass bottles. rmbc our joint venture with owensbrockway glass container inc. owens produces approximately of our u.s. glass bottle requirements at our glass manufacturing facility in wheat ridge colorado. in july we extended our joint venture with owens for years as well as a supply agreement with owens for the glass bottles we require in excess of joint venture production. kegs the remaining of u.s. volume we sold in was packaged in quarter half and one sixth barrel stainless steel kegs. a limited number of kegs are purchased each year and there is no longterm supply agreement. other packaging crowns labels corrugate and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. we purchase most of our paperboard from a subsidiary of graphic packaging corporation gpc a related party. cbc does not foresee difficulties in accessing these products in the future. seasonality of the business our u.s. sales volumes are normally lowest in the first and fourth quarters and highest in the second and third quarters. competitive conditions known trends and competitive conditions industry and competitive information in this section and elsewhere in this report was compiled from various industry sources including beverage analyst reports beer marketers insights impact databank and the beer institute and distributors. while management believes that these sources are reliable we cannot guarantee the accuracy of these numbers and estimates. u.s. beer industry overview the beer industry in the united states is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented with a profusion of offerings in the abovepremium category. with respect to premium lagerstyle beer three major brewers control approximately of the market. growing or even maintaining market share has required increasing investments in marketing and sales. u.s. beer industry shipments had an annual growth rate during the past years of .. price discounting in the u.s. beer industry was less intense in compared with a high level of promotions in the second half of . since the change in the excise tax structure in puerto rico in june the beer market there has been in modest decline. additionally while this market has traditionally been split among u.s. imports other foreign imports and local brewers due to the tax advantage held by the local brewer the medalla brand has gained significant share in the past several years. coors light remains the market leader in puerto rico with an approximate market share. our competitive position our malt beverages compete with numerous abovepremium premium lowcalorie popularpriced nonalcoholic and imported brands. these competing brands are produced by national regional local and international brewers. we compete most directly with anheuserbusch and sab miller sab. we also compete with imported craft beer brands. according to beer marketers insights estimates we are the nations thirdlargest brewer selling approximately of the total u.s. brewing industry shipments including exports and u.s. shipments of imports. this compares to anheuserbuschs share and sabs share. our malt beverages also compete with other alcohol beverages including wine and spirits and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years resulting in a reduction in the beer segments lead in the overall alcoholic beverages market. europe segment coors brewers ltd cbl is the united kingdoms secondlargest beer company with unit volume sales of approximately . million u.s. barrels in . cbl has an approximate share of the u.k. beer market western europes secondlargest market. sales are primarily in england and wales with the carling brand a mainstream lager representing more than three fourths of cbls total beer volume. the europe segment consists of our production and sale of the cbl brands principally in the united kingdom our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of grolsch in the united kingdom and republic of ireland factored brand sales beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to retail by us and our joint venture arrangement with dhl formerly exel logistics for the distribution of products throughout great britain through tradeteam. our europe segment also manages a small volume of sales primarily of coors products in asia and other export markets. sales and distribution united kingdom in the united kingdom beer is generally distributed through a twotier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers. unlike the united states where manufacturers are generally not permitted to distribute beer directly to retail the large majority of our beer in the united kingdom is sold directly to retailers. it is also common in the u.k. for brewers to distribute beer wine spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the onpremise channel where products are consumed in bars and restaurants. approximately of cbls net sales value in was these factored brands. distribution activities for cbl are conducted by tradeteam which operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet. tradeteam also manages the transportation of malt to the cbl breweries. over the past three decades volumes have shifted from the higher margin onpremise channel where products are consumed in pubs and restaurants to the lower margin offpremise channel also referred to as the takehome market. onpremise market channel the onpremise channel accounted for approximately of our u.k. sales volumes in . the onpremise channel is generally segregated further into two more specific categories multiple onpremise and free onpremise. multiple onpremise refers to those customers that own a number of pubs and restaurants and free onpremise refers to individual owneroperators of pubs and restaurants. the ongoing market trend from the highermargin free onpremise channel to the lowermargin multiple onpremise puts the europe segments profitability at risk. in cbl sold approximately and of its onpremise volume to multiple and free onpremise customers respectively. in recent years pricing in the onpremise channel has intensified as the retail pub chains have consolidated. as a result the larger pub chains have been able to negotiate lower beer prices from brewers which have not consolidated during this time. the installation and maintenance of draught beer dispensing equipment in the onpremise channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer in the united kingdom. accordingly cbl owns equipment used to dispense beer from kegs to consumers. this includes beer lines cooling equipment taps and countermounts. similar to other u.k. brewers cbl has traditionally used loans to secure supply relationships with customers in the onpremise market. loans are normally granted at belowmarket rates of interest with the outlet purchasing beer at lowerthanaverage discount levels to compensate. we reclassify a portion of sales revenue as interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans. offpremise market channel the offpremise channel accounted for approximately of our u.k. sales volume in . the offpremise market includes sales to supermarket chains convenience stores liquor store chains distributors and wholesalers. asia we continue to develop markets in asia which are managed by the europe segments management team. we have a japanese business which is currently focused on the zima and coors brands. in china our business is principally focused on the coors light brand. product sold in japan and china is contract brewed by a third party in china. the small amount of remaining asia volume is exported from the u.s. manufacturing production and packaging brewing raw materials we use the highestquality water barley and hops to brew our products. during cbl produced more than of its required malt using barley purchased from sources in the united kingdom. cbl does not anticipate significant challenges in procuring quality malt for the foreseeable future. malt sourced externally is committed through and is produced through a toll malting agreement where cbl purchases the required barley and pays a conversion fee to the malt vendor. hops and adjunct starches used in the brewing process are purchased from agricultural sources in the united kingdom and on the european continent. cbl does not anticipate difficulties in accessing these products going forward. we assure the highestquality water by obtaining our water from private water sources that are carefully chosen for their purity and are regularly tested to ensure their ongoing purity and to confirm that all the requirements of the u.k. private water regulations are met. public supplies are used as backup to the private supplies in some breweries and these are again tasted and tested regularly to ensure their ongoing purity. brewing and packaging facilities we operate three breweries in the united kingdom. the burtonontrent brewery located in the midlands is the largest brewery in the united kingdom and accounts for approximately two thirds of cbls production. smaller breweries are located in tadcaster and alton. product sold in ireland and certain asia markets is produced by contract brewers. packaging materials kegs and casks we used kegs and casks for approximately of our u.k. products in reflecting a high percentage of product sold onpremise. cbl does not own its own kegs but rather fills and ships kegs owned by a third party who manages the supply and maintenance of kegs and casks. see item a. risk factors related to the europe segment for further discussion. aluminum cans approximately of our u.k. products were packaged in cans in . all of our cans are purchased through a supply contract with ball. glass bottles approximately of our u.k. products are packaged in glass bottles purchased through supply contracts with thirdparty suppliers. other packaging the remaining of our u.k. sales are shipped in bulk tanker for other brewers to package. crowns labels corrugate and paperboard are purchased from concentrated sources unique to each product. cbl does not foresee difficulties in accessing these or other packaging materials in the foreseeable future. seasonality of business in the u.k. the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations primarily influenced by holiday periods weather and by certain major televised sporting events such as the world cup soccer tournament in the summer of . peak selling seasons occur during the summer and during the christmas and new year periods. the christmasnew year holiday peak is most pronounced in the offpremise channel. consequently our largest quarters by volume are the third and fourth quarters and the smallest are the first and second. competitive conditions u.k. beer industry overview beer consumption in the united kingdom declined by an average of . per annum between and . total trade beer market volume declined by . in . this was the third consecutive year of decline and reverses the relatively stable trend seen during to . the longerterm decline has been mainly attributable to the onpremise channel where volumes are now approximately lower than in . over the same period offpremise volume has increased by approximately . this trend is expected to continue and has been caused by a number of factors including changes in consumers lifestyles and an increasing price difference between beer prices in the onpremise higher prices and offpremise lower prices channels. both trends continued in with offpremise industry market growth of . and a decline in the onpremise market of .. there has also been a steady trend away from ales and towards lager driven predominantly by the leading lager brands. in lagers accounted for of beer sales and in lagers accounted for almost of u.k. beer sales. while lager volume has been growing ales including stouts have declined during this period and this trend has accelerated in the last few years. the leading beer brands are generally growing at a faster rate than the market. the top brands now represent approximately of the total market compared to only in . our competitive position our beers and flavored alcohol beverages compete not only with similar products from competitors but also with other alcohol beverages including wines spirits and ciders. with the exception of stout where we do not have our own brand our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer categories. our strength in the growing lager category with carling grolsch coors fine light beer and c positions us well to take advantage of the continuing trend toward lagers. our portfolio has been strengthened by the introduction of a range of imported and speciality beer brands such as sol zatec palm and kasteel cru. our principal competitors are scottish newcastle u.k. ltd. inbev u.k. ltd. and carlsberg u.k. ltd. we are the u.k.s secondlargest brewer with a market share of approximately excluding factored brands sales based on ac nielsen information. this compares to scottish newcastle u.k. ltd.s share of approximately inbev u.k. ltd.s share of approximately and carlsberg u.k. ltd.s share of approximately . in cbl achieved a small increase in its share of the u.k. beer market and two of our three core brandscarling and coors fine light beerincreased their product category share in . global intellectual property we own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce and have licenses for the remainder. we also hold several patents on innovative processes related to product formula can making can decorating and certain other technical operations. these patents have expiration dates through . we are not reliant on royalty or other revenue from third parties for our financial success. therefore these expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our business. inflation inflation is typically a factor in the segments in which we operate although we periodically experience inflationary trends in specific areas such as fuel costs which were significantly higher in when compared to prior years. inflation in diesel fuel costs impacts the u.s. segment most significantly due to the geographic size of the u.s. market and the concentration of production at fewer facilities. the u.s. segment is also the most exposed to inflation in aluminum prices since it packages the majority of its product in aluminum cans. regulation canada in canada provincial governments regulate the production marketing distribution sale and pricing of beer and impose commodity taxes and license fees in relation to the production and sale of beer. in canada excise taxes totaled . million or . per barrel sold. in addition the federal government regulates the advertising labeling quality control and international trade of beer and also imposes commodity taxes consumption taxes excise taxes and in certain instances custom duties on imported beer. further certain bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government provincial governments and certain foreign governments especially with the united states affect the canadian beer industry. united states in the united states the beer business is regulated by federal state and local governments. these regulations govern many parts of our operations including brewing marketing and advertising transportation distributor relationships sales and environmental issues. to operate our facilities we must obtain and maintain numerous permits licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies including the u.s. treasury department alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau the u.s. department of agriculture the u.s. food and drug administration state alcohol regulatory agencies as well as state and federal environmental agencies. governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. u.s. federal excise taxes on malt beverages are currently per barrel. state excise taxes also are levied at rates that ranged in from a high of . per barrel in alaska to a low of . per barrel in wyoming. in u.s. excise taxes totaled . million or . per barrel sold. europe in the united kingdom regulations apply to many parts of our operations and products including brewing food safety labeling and packaging marketing and advertising environmental health and safety employment and data protection regulations. to operate our breweries and carry on business in the united kingdom we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and licenses from local licensing justices and governmental bodies including her majestys revenue customs hmrc the office of fair trading the data protection commissioner and the environment agency. in a smoking ban in public places will take effect across the remainder of great britain. the ban will come into force on april in wales april in northern ireland and july in england and is expected to have a significant unfavorable volume impact in the on premise channel in the shortterm but potentially increase volume in the offpremise market as consumers adjust their consumption patterns to the new environment. a ban already exists in scotland and republic of ireland and in these geographies the experience was as we have outlined in our expectation for wales northern ireland and england. the u.k. government levies excise taxes on all alcohol beverages at varying rates depending on the type of product and its alcohol content by volume. in we incurred approximately . billion in excise taxes on gross revenues of approximately . billion or approximately . per barrel. environmental matters canada our canadian brewing operations are subject to provincial environmental regulations and local permit requirements. each of our canadian breweries other than the st. johns brewery has water treatment facilities to pretreat waste water before it goes to the respective local governmental facility for final treatment. we have environmental programs in canada including organization monitoring and verification regulatory compliance reporting education and training and corrective action. molson sold a chemical specialties business in . the company is responsible for certain aspects of environmental remediation undertaken or planned at the business sites. we have established provisions for the costs of these remediation programs. united states we are one of a number of entities named by the environmental protection agency epa as a potentially responsible party prp at the lowry superfund site. this landfill is owned by the city and county of denver denver and is managed by waste management of colorado inc. waste management. in we recorded a pretax charge of million a portion of which was put into a trust in as part of a settlement with denver and waste management regarding then outstanding litigation. our settlement was based on an assumed remediation cost of million in adjusted dollars. the settlement requires us to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount. considering uncertainties at the site including what additional remedial actions may be required by the epa new technologies and what costs are included in the determination of when the million threshold is reached the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. we cannot predict the amount or timing of any such change but additional accruals could be required in the future. we are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in colorado resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities. there may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware. from time to time we have been notified that we are or may be a prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. while we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved we believe that any payments if required for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results cash flows or our financial or competitive position. we believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. europe we are subject to the requirements of government and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. compliance with these laws and regulations did not materially affect our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that they will do so in . employees and employee relations canada molson has approximately fulltime employees in canada. approximately of this total workforce is represented by trade unions. workplace change initiatives are continuing and as a result joint union and management steering committees established in most breweries are focusing on customer service quality continuous improvement employee training and a growing degree of employee involvement in all areas of brewery operations. the agreement governing our relationship with employees at the edmonton brewery is set to expire in . we believe that relations with our canada employees are good. united states we have approximately employees in our u.s. segment. less than of our u.s. work force is represented by unions. we believe that relations with our u.s. employees are good. europe we have approximately employees in our europe segment. approximately of this total workforce is represented by trade unions primarily at our burtonontrent and tadcaster breweries. the agreements do not have expiration dates and negotiations are conducted annually. we believe that relations with our europe employees are good. d financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales see the consolidated financial statements in item

document and we do not undertake any obligation to update forwardlooking statements to reflect new information subsequent events or otherwise. item a. risk factors the reader should carefully consider the following factors and the other information contained within this document. the most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following risks specific to our company if pentland and the coors trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders generally the matter will not be approved even if beneficial to the company or favored by other stockholders. pentland and the coors trust which together control more than twothirds of the companys class a common and exchangeable stock have voting trust agreements through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our class a common stock and the class a exchangeable shares that they own. however in the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote other than the election of directors the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the class a common stock and class a exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. there is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. therefore if either pentland or the coors trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a stockholder vote we may be unable to complete the transaction even if our board management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficial for molson coors. our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of three primary products in three mature markets the failure or weakening of one or more could materially adversely affect our financial results. although we currently have products in our u.s. portfolio coors light represented more than of our u.s. segments sales volume for . carling lager is the best selling brand in the united kingdom and represented more than of our european segments sales volume in . the combination of the molson canadian and coors light brands represented more than of our canada segments sales volume in . consequently any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands or from the categories in which they compete would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our business. moreover each of our three major markets is mature and we face large competitors who have greater financial marketing and distribution resources and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity which could hinder our ability to adjust to rapid changes in market conditions or to respond to competitive pressures. as of december we had approximately million in debt primarily related to our acquisition of cbl and . billion of debt primarily related to our merger with molson. as a result we must use a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt. if our financial and operating performance does not generate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities our operations could be adversely impacted. we rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging we need to operate our business. the inability to obtain materials could unfavorably affect our ability to produce our products. for our u.s. business we purchase most of our paperboard and container supplies from a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. this packaging is unique and is not produced by any other supplier. additionally we are contractually obligated to purchase substantially all our can and bottle needs in the united states and canada from our container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures ball corporation rmmc and owensbrockway glass container inc. rmbc. consolidation of the glass bottle industry in north america has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. cbl has a single source for its can supply ball. the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business. our primary production facilities in europe and the united states are located at single sites so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors to transportation disruptions fuel increases and natural disasters. our primary production facility in the united states is in golden colorado and in europe our primary production facility is located in burtonontrent england. in both segments our competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. as a result we must ship our products greater distances than some of our competitors making us more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel as well as the impact of any localized natural disasters should they occur. the termination of one or more manufacturerdistribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business. we manufacture andor distribute products of other beverage companies including those of one or more competitors through various licensing distribution or other arrangements in canada and the united kingdom. the loss of one or more of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the results of one or more reporting segments. because we will continue to face intense global competition operating results may be unfavorably impacted. the brewing industry is highly competitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce prices increase capital and other expenditures or lose sales volume any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. in addition in some of our markets our primary competitors have substantially greater financial marketing production and distribution resources than molson coors has. in all of the markets where molson coors operates aggressive marketing strategies by our main competitors could adversely affect our financial results. changes in tax environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our business is highly regulated by federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices labeling advertising promotion and marketing practices relationships with distributors environmental matters smoking bans at onpremise locations and other matters. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the loss revocation or suspension of our licenses permits or approvals. in addition changes in tax environmental or any other laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates most significantly the british pound and the canadian dollar. we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies most significantly in canada and in the united kingdom. since our financial statements are presented in usd we must translate our assets liabilities income and expenses into usd at current exchange rates. increases and decreases in the value of the usd will affect perhaps adversely the value of these items in our financial statements even if their local currency value has not changed. our operations face significant commodity price change and foreign exchange rate exposure which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. we use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce our products including barley barley malt hops various starches water and packaging materials including aluminum and paper products. we also use a significant amount of diesel fuel in our operations. the supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices frosts droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions plant diseases and theft. to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. we have active hedging programs to address commodity price and foreign exchange rate changes. however to the extent we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates or commodity price risks including price risk associated with diesel fuel and aluminum both of which are at historically high price levels our results of operations may be adversely impacted. we could be adversely affected by overall declines in the beer market. consumer trends in some global markets indicate increases in consumer preference for wine and spirits as well as for lower priced value segment beer brands in some canadian markets which could result in loss of volume or a deterioration of operating margins. because of our reliance on a single information technology service supplier we could experience significant disruption to our business. we rely exclusively on one information technology services provider worldwide for our network help desk hardware and software configuration. if that service provider fails and we are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner we could be unable to properly administer our information technology systems. due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the united kingdom and canada we could be significantly affected by labor strikes work stoppages or other employeerelated issues. approximately of molsons total workforce and approximately of cbls total workforce is represented by trade unions. although we believe relations with our employees are good stringent labor laws in the united kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products could adversely impact our business. in the u.s. supreme court ruled that certain state regulations of interstate wine shipments are unlawful. as a result of this decision states may alter the threetier distribution system that has historically applied to the distribution of our products. changes to the threetier distribution system could have a materially adverse impact on our business. further in certain canadian provinces our products are distributed through joint venture arrangements that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. if provincial regulation should change effectively eliminating the distribution channels the costs to adjust our distribution methods could have a material adverse impact on our business. risks specific to our discontinued operations indemnities provided to the purchaser of of the kaiser business in brazil could result in future cash outflows and statement of operations charges. on january we agreed to sell a equity interest in kaiser to femsa for million cash including the assumption by femsa of kaiserrelated debt and certain contingencies. in november we divested our remaining ownership interest in kaiser and received . million resulting in an increase of femsas purchased ownership of kaiser to . the terms of our agreement require us to indemnify femsa for exposures related to certain tax civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. the ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control and we cannot predict the outcomes of administrative and judicial proceedings that will occur with regard to these claims. it is possible that we will have to make cash outlays to femsa with regard to these indemnities. while the fair values of these indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet in conjunction with the sale we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our fair value estimates or change in assessment of probability of loss on these items. due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies significant adjustments to the carrying value of our indemnity liabilities and corresponding statement of operations chargescredits could result in the future. risks specific to the canada segment we may be required to provide funding to the entity that owns the montral canadiens hockey club and the related entertainment business pursuant to the guarantees given to the national hockey league nhl. pursuant to certain guarantees given to the nhl as a minority owner of the entertainment business and the montral canadiens professional hockey club majority ownership sold by molson in molson may have to provide funding to the club joint and severally based on our . ownership to meet its obligations and its operating expenses if the club cannot meet its obligations under various agreements. an adverse result in a lawsuit brought by miller could have an adverse impact on our business. in december miller brewing company sued the company and several subsidiaries in a wisconsin federal court. miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement allowing molson canada the sole distribution of miller products in canada. miller claims u.s. and canadian antitrust violations and violations of the agreements confidentiality provisions. miller also claims that the agreements purposes have been frustrated as a result of the molson coors merger. if miller were to prevail in this action it could have an adverse impact on our business and we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of the . million carrying value of our intangible asset associated with the miller arrangements. if we are unsuccessful in maintaining licensing distribution and related agreements our business could suffer adverse effects. we manufacture andor distribute products of other beverage companies in canada including those of one or more competitors through various licensing distribution or other arrangements. the loss of one or more of these arrangements could adversely impact our business. if the maritime provinces refuse to recognize our new brewery in moncton new brunswick as a local brewer we will not be able to use that facility as planned. we are completing a brewery in moncton new brunswick. we decided to build it on the basis of assurances from canadas maritime provinces which include new brunswick and nova scotia that the facility would qualify as a local brewer under the maritime accord so that beer shipped to other maritime provinces would be subject to much lower handling fees than beer shipped from elsewhere in canada. there is risk that certain maritime provinces will not honor their previous assurances. if so our return on investment would be substantially lower than planned and we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of the . million spent to construct the brewery. risks specific to the u.s. segment litigation directed at the alcohol beverage industry may adversely affect our sales volumes our business and our financial results. molson coors and other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. the suits allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to children and other underage consumers. in essence each suit seeks on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians an injunction and unspecified money damages. we will vigorously defend these lawsuits several of which have been dismissed and are now on appeal. it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any that may result from these lawsuits. we are highly dependent on independent distributors in the united states to sell our products with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products. we sell all of our products in the united states to distributors for resale to retail outlets. some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. these distributors may give our competitors products higher priority thereby reducing sales of our products. in addition the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. consequently if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors our business financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected. risks specific to the europe segment sales volume trends in the united kingdom brewing industry reflect movement from on premise channels to offpremise channels a trend which unfavorably impacts our profitability. we have noted in recent years that beer volume sales in the u.k. have been shifting from pubs and restaurants onpremise to retail stores offpremise for the industry in general. the progression to a ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants across the whole of the u.k. anticipated to be effective in is likely to accelerate this trend. margins on sales to offpremise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to onpremise customers hence these trends could adversely impact our profitability. consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the united kingdom could result in less ability to achieve favorable pricing. the trend toward consolidation of pubs away from independent pub and club operations is continuing in the united kingdom. these larger entities have stronger price negotiating power and therefore continuation of this trend could impact cbls ability to obtain favorable pricing in the onpremise channel due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. in addition these larger customers continue to move to purchasing directly more of the products that in the past we have provided as part of our factored business. further consolidation could impact us adversely. we depend exclusively on one logistics provider in england wales and scotland for distribution of our cbl products. we are a party to a joint venture with dhl called tradeteam. tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for cbl in england wales and scotland except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. if tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our products and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have an adverse financial impact. we are reliant on a single third party as a supplier for kegs in the united kingdom. our cbl business uses kegs managed by a logistics provider who is responsible for providing an adequate stock of kegs as well as their upkeep. due to greater than anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees attributable to reduced overall volume the logistics provider has encountered financial difficulty. as a result of action taken by the logistics providers lending institution related to perceived financial difficulties of the borrower the logistics provider has been forced into administration restructuring proceedings and the bank on february exercised its option to put the keg population to cbl. as a result we expect to purchase the existing keg population from the logistics providers lender at fair value pursuant to the terms of the agreement between cbl and the logistics providers lender. we estimate that this potential capital expenditure which may be financed over a period of time in excess of one year could amount to approximately million to million which is not included in the capital expenditures plan. as a result of this capital requirement we may reduce other elements of our capital expenditures plan or offset risk posed by the potential keg purchase through increased cash generation efforts. we may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives. in connection with various business combinations we have allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. these assets are tested for impairment at least annually using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. in the event that the adverse financial impact of current trends with respect to our u.k. business continue and including the potential impact of an expected smoking ban in onpremise locations across the whole of the u.k. in are worse than we anticipate we may be required to record impairment charges. this could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. item b. unresolved staff comments

provincial courts in ontario and qubec alleging among other things that the company and its affiliated entities including molson inc. and certain officers and directors misled stockholders by failing to disclose first quarter januarymarch u.s. business trends prior to the merger vote in january . the colorado case has since been transferred to delaware and consolidated with one of those cases. one of the lawsuits filed in delaware federal court also alleges that the company failed to comply with u.s. gaap. the company will vigorously defend the lawsuits. in may the company was contacted by the central regional office of the u.s. securities and exchange commission in denver the sec requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other information from the company and molson inc. relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related to the merger the companys financial results for the first quarter of and other information. in november the company received a letter from the sec stating that this matter in the matter of molson coors brewing company da has been recommended for termination and no enforcement action has been recommended to the commission. the information in the secs letter was provided under the guidelines in the final paragraph of securities act release no. . the company was contacted by the new york stock exchange in june requesting information in connection with events leading up to the companys earnings announcement on april which was the date we announced our first quarter losses attributed to lower sales and the merger. the exchange regularly conducts reviews of market activity surrounding corporate announcements or events and has indicated that no inference of impropriety should be drawn from its inquiry. the company cooperated with this inquiry. as a matter of policy the exchange does not comment publicly on the status of its investigations. however we have not been contacted by the nyse with respect to this investigation in approximately months. if there were any formal action taken by the nyse it would be in the form of an investigatory panel decision. such decisions are publicly available. in july the ontario securities commission commission requested information related to the trading of mcbc stock prior to april which was the date we announced our first quarter losses attributed to lower sales and the merger. the company cooperated with the inquiry. the commission has advised the company that it has closed the file on this matter without action of any kind. in early october the audit committee of the companys board of directors concluded its investigation of whether a complaint that it received in the third quarter of had any merit. the complaint related primarily to disclosure in connection with the merger exercises of stock options by molson inc. option holders before the record date for the special dividend paid to molson inc. shareholders before the merger which were disclosed in the companys report on form k dated february statements made concerning the special dividend to molson inc. shareholders and sales of the companys common stock in connection with exercise of stock options by the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer following the merger after the release of the yearend results for coors and molson inc. and after the company lifted the trading restrictions imposed before the merger. the audit committees independent counsel which was retained to assist in conducting the investigation reviewed and discussed with the staff of the sec the various findings of an approximately month long investigation conducted by the independent counsel. the audit committee determined after thoroughly reviewing the facts and in consultation with its independent counsel to conclude the investigation. in concluding the investigation the audit committee determined that the various matters referred to in the complaint were without merit. in december miller brewing company sued the company and several subsidiaries in a wisconsin federal court. miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement the agreement allowing molson canada the sole distribution of miller products in canada. miller also seeks damages for u.s. and canadian antitrust violations and violations of the agreements confidentiality provisions. miller also claimed that the agreements purposes have been frustrated as a result of the merger. the company has filed a claim against miller and certain related entities in ontario canada seeking a declaration that the licensing agreement remains in full force and effect. we are currently in discussions with miller regarding a resolution of this dispute. there can be no assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution. in late october molson canada received a letter from fosters group limited providing twelve months notice of its intention to terminate the fosters u.s. license agreement due to the merger. the agreement provides molson canada with the right to produce fosters beer for the u.s. marketplace. in november molson canada filed a notice of action in ontario canada disputing the validity of the termination notice. in december fosters filed a separate application in ontario canada seeking termination of the agreement. molson canada will vigorously defend its rights in these matters. molson coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. the suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to children and other underage consumers. in essence each suit seeks on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians an injunction and unspecified money damages. in each suit the manufacturers have advanced motions for dismissal to the court. several of the lawsuits have been dismissed on appeal. there have been no appellate decisions. we will vigorously defend these cases and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any related to these lawsuits. cbl replaced a bonus plan in the united kingdom with a different plan under which a bonus was not paid in . a group of employees pursued a claim against cbl with respect to this issue with an employment tribunal. during the second quarter of the tribunal ruled against cbl. cbl appealed this ruling and the appeal was heard in the first quarter of where most impacts of the initial tribunal judgments were overturned. however the employment appeal tribunal remitted two specific issues back to a new employment tribunal. cbl appealed the employment appeal tribunals judgment. in january the appeal decision was ruled in the companys favor holding that the employment tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the employees claims and the claims were dismissed. it is possible that the employees may attempt to advance their claims in a different forum. we are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings in our opinion based on a review with legal counsel none of these disputes and legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows. however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters including the abovedescribed advertising practices case may arise from time to time that may harm our business. item . submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable. part ii item . market for

consequently a portion of the growth in volume revenue and profit is due to the inclusion of the canada segment for the full year in versus fortyfive and onehalf weeks for the year ended . also our fiscal year included weeks compared to weeks in . the rd week in our fiscal increased total company sales volume by approximately thousand barrels and pretax profit by approximately million. our performance in our second year as a merged companydemonstrated that our brand growth strategies and costreduction efforts continue to strengthen our competitive capabilities and financial performance. we achieved revenue and profit growth despite substantial competitive and inflationary cost challenges in each of our major markets. we achieved several critical successes in we grew volume in all of our businesses on the strength of our leading brands. we gained market share in the u.s. and u.k. and improved our canada share trends substantially versus the premerger trend that molson experienced. we increased revenue per barrel in canada and in the u.s. supported by our brandbuilding efforts. we captured more than million of cost reductions across our company including nearly million of merger synergiesmore than above our original synergies goal for . we continued to invest strategically behind our brand equities and in our sales execution capabilities in each of our businesses. we invested in capital and other projects most significantly in the shenandoah brewery in the u.s. that will help us to continue to reduce our fixedcost structure and grow earnings and financial flexibility. we generated . million of operating cash flow and repaid all commercial paper borrowings and all borrowings under our credit facility by the end of the year. we achieved these results with a focus on building strong brands while controlling and reducing costs across our company. synergies and other cost savings initiatives the company originally targeted million of annual mergerrelated savings for . during the course of the year we increased our target to million and achieved million in annual synergies during . combined with the million of synergy savings achieved in we have captured a total of million of synergies over the past two years. we expect to exceed the total synergies goal of million during . moreover we are developing and implementing a next generation of cost savings initiatives which are in varying stages of development. income taxes our full year effective tax rate was . in and . in . our effective tax rate was significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the following lower income tax rates applicable to our canadian and u.k. businesses and onetime benefits from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions in foreign income tax rates. our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to lower income tax rates applicable to our canadian and u.k. businesses and a one time benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through december as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of apb accounting for income taxesspecial areas and sfas accounting for income taxes. components of our statement of operations net salesour net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and other malt beverages the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. we import or brew and sell certain nonowned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. we also sell certain factored brands as a distributor to onpremise customers in the united kingdom europe segment. cost of goods soldour cost of goods sold include costs we incur to make and ship beer. these costs include brewing materials such as barley in the united states and united kingdom where we manufacture the majority of our own malt. in canada we purchase malt from third parties. hops and various grains are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our segments. packaging materials including costs for glass bottles aluminum and steel cans and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor freight costs utilities maintenance costs and other manufacturing overheads. marketing general and administrativethese costs include media advertising television radio print tactical advertising signs banners pointofsale materials and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments. these costs also include our sales organizations including labor and other overheads. this classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance legal human resources and information technology which consist primarily of labor and outside services. special itemsthese are unique infrequent and unusual items which affect our statement of operations and are discussed in each segments results of operations discussion. interest income expenseinterest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are classified here. interest income in the europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers. other income expensethis classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. for instance gains or losses on sales of nonoperating assets our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in tradeteam and the montral canadiens hockey club and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here. discussions of statement of operations line items such as minority interests discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in detail elsewhere in mda and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item . discontinued operations the companys former brazil business kaiser which was acquired as part of the merger is reported as a discontinued operation due to the sale of a controlling interest in the business on january . proceeds from the sale were million cash less . million of transaction costs. we divested our remaining interest in kaiser during the fourth quarter for which we received . million including . million of accrued interest. the loss from discontinued operations of . million for the year ended is composed of the following components losses generated by kaiser prior to the sale of . million. a loss on the january sale of of the business of . million. unfavorable adjustments to indemnity liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in estimates of . million. a net loss of . million as a result of the exercise of the put option on our remaining common ownership interest. the net result of a gain from the proceeds from the exercise of our put option was more than offset by a loss due to the increase in our indemnity liabilities as a result of purchasers increased ownership level. see note to the consolidated financial statements in item . during kaiser generated pretax losses of . million due to operating losses and special charges associated with increasing reserves for contingent liabilities. in conjunction with this transaction the purchaser femsa assumed million of financial debt and assumed contingent liabilities of approximately million related primarily to tax claims subject to our indemnification. we have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of kaiser as well as previously disclosed but less than probable unaccrued claims due to certain indemnities provided to femsa pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement. while we believe that all significant contingencies were disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on kaisers financial statements resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could under some circumstances result in additional cash outflows for molson coors because of transactionrelated indemnity provisions. we have recorded these indemnity liabilities at fair value and have a carrying value at december of . million. due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies there could be significant adjustments in the future. cumulative effect of change in accounting principle molson coors has adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no. accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. fin under which companies must recognize potential longterm liabilities related to the eventual retirement of assets. as a result of adopting fin we recorded a cumulative non cash expense of . million after tax in the fourth quarter reported as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the companys statement of operations. as reported in our fourth quarter and full year results these liabilities represent accumulated remediation and restoration costs expected to be incurred up to years in the future for anticipated asset retirements. costs related to fin were not significant in and following this cumulative catchup expense recorded in the fourth quarter of we do not expect fin related expense to have a significant impact on our annual operating results. results of operations canada segment before the merger the canada segment consisted of coors brewing companys . interest in the coors canada partnership ccp through which the coors light business in canada was conducted. ccp contracted with molson for the brewing distribution and the sale of coors light products while ccp managed all marketing activities in canada. in connection with the merger ccp was dissolved into the canadian business. coors accounted for its interest in ccp using the equity method of accounting. following the merger our canada segment consists primarily of molsons beer business including the production and sale of the molson brands coors light and other licensed brands principally in canada. the canada segment also includes our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in ontario brewers retail inc. bri

. million barrels versus pro forma volume of . million. the rd week in accounted for approximately thousand barrels providing the yearoveryear increase. on a pro forma basis molson strategic brands grew at midsingledigit rates lead by coors light rickards and our partner import brands all of which grew at doubledigit rates on a full year basis. these increases were partially offset by declines in unsupported brands and other premium brands reductions in contract packaging of nonowned brands for export shipment and the discontinuation of molson kick and a marca bavaria. on a full year basis net sales revenue grew . million or . versus prior year. on a comparable pro forma basis net sales revenue grew . million or . with approximately growth in local currency on a per barrel basis. for the full year net sales revenue was . per barrel an increase of . over comparable net sales revenue of . per barrel. an approximate appreciation in the value of cad against usd during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately million. the remainder of the increase was driven by the year over year impact of modest general price increases and improved sales mix from increased import sales which are at higher than average retail prices. these improvements were partially offset by increased price discounting during the year predominantly in ontario and qubec. for the year ended december pro forma net sales were . billion . higher than the comparable period in the prior year. net sales revenue per barrel grew slightly in local currency for the year ended december driven by modest general price increases offset by unfavorable product mix. net unfavorable sales mix was driven by value segment growth primarily in ontario and alberta which was partially offset by improved import sales at higher than average sale prices. canada segment net sales volume for the year ended december decreased . to . million barrels on a comparable pro forma basis from . the decrease was driven by volume declines in the first quarter partially offset by strong industry volume trends and improved sales activity and market performance over the balance of . cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold increased . million or . in versus prior year. on a comparable pro forma basis cost of goods sold increased . million or . decreasing slightly less than on a per barrel basis in local currency. cost of goods sold was . per barrel an increase of . over s pro forma cost of goods sold of . per barrel. after adjusting for the approximate appreciation in the value of cad against usd cost of goods sold decreased by slightly less than in in local currency. inflationary cost increases across nearly all inputs drove approximately increase in cost of goods sold per barrel. these and other cost increases were completely offset by implementation of synergies and other cost savings initiatives lower input costs related to favorable foreign currency and lower employeerelated expenses in . finally a reduction was due to a million benefit in the fourth quarter of related to a onetime noncash adjustment of certain foreign currency positions to their market values. on a pro forma basis cost of goods sold increased . to . million for the year ended december from . million in the same period for . for the same period in local currency cost of goods sold per barrel in canada decreased as synergy and other cost savings were offset by unfavorable product mix. marketing general and administrative expenses marketing general and administrative expenses increased . million for . this is an increase of . million or . on a comparable pro forma basis. in local currency total marketing general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately . due to lower promotional spending and brand investments in due in part to cycling of the promotional launch of molson kick and a marca bavaria in and partly to offset price discounting. these costs were partially offset by higher employee expenses and onetime costs in including incremental spending as a result of the additional week in results. on a pro forma basis marketing general and administrative expenses increased . to . million for from . million in the same period for . canada increased marketing and sales spending at a highsingledigit growth rate. in local currency general and administrative costs increased due to higher depreciation increased employee costs and non recurring items partially offset by mergerrelated synergies. special items net there were no special items in . special items net of . million in were attributable primarily to restructuring the sales and marketing organizations in canada. on a pro forma basis special items net in of . million were mergerrelated and therefore did not recur in . other expense income net in other income increased . million over the prior year. on a pro forma basis other income increased . million over the prior year or . million in local currency. other income primarily represents equity earnings and amortization expense related to the montral canadiens hockey club the club which improved over the prior year. during the year the entities which control and own a majority of the club purchased the preferred shares in the club held by molson. in addition molson was released from a direct guarantee associated with the clubs debt financing and as a result of the reduction in our financial risk profile we have reevaluated our remaining guarantee liabilities specifically under the nhl consent agreement and the bell centre land lease guarantees resulting in an approximate . million income benefit associated with the reduction in the exposure attributable to such guarantees. other expense in represents the equity losses in the montral canadiens hockey club. united states segment the united states u.s. segment produces markets and sells the coors and molson portfolios of

sales sales volume to wholesalers grew . in compared to . without the rd week in volume growth would have been approximately .. the growth was driven by low singledigit growth for the coors light brand highsingledigit growth of keystone light and doubledigit growth of the blue moon brand. excluding our caribbean business which was impacted by a weak economy and a new sales tax enacted in puerto rico during the year our states salestoretail strs grew . from a year ago. coors light achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of total channel u.s. growth and grew share in the grocery and convenience store channels according to external retail sales data reports. this continued volume momentum was driven by building our brand equities through our coors light advertising rocky mountain cold refreshment focus as well as better alignment with our distributor network and improving our effectiveness with chain retail accounts. net sales per barrel increased . in due to higher base

in versus driven by volume increases in the coors light keystone light and blue moon brands and the addition of molson brands sold in the united states that were included in u.s. results following the merger. net sales per barrel increased . from to . we experienced favorable gross pricing in partially offset by significant price promotions and coupon activity in key markets. these pricing factors accounted for approximately onehalf of the increase in revenue per barrel while the balance of the revenue per barrel growth was due primarily to collection of fuel surcharges from customers and higher sales of import brands through companyowned distributorships. cost of goods sold cost of goods sold per barrel increased by . to . per barrel in versus . per barrel in . the net increase in cost of goods sold was driven by four primary factors inflationary increases across nearly all facets of our operations including packaging materials freight rates fuel and various components of labor and laborrelated costs resulted in an approximate increase in cost of goods per barrel. approximately three quarters of those inflationary increases are attributable to commodities with the balance attributable to labor and laborrelated increases. innovative promotional packaging initiatives that are helping to drive sales of coors light and other brands resulted in approximately of the increase. these include our plastic bottle cooler box cold wrap bottle and frostbrew can liner. certain initiatives that will yield lower costs in future years resulted in temporarily higher costs in and accounted for approximately of the total increase. these initiatives included costs related to temporary process changes and new contract packaging and freight arrangements related to closing our memphis brewery in september . savings from our operations cost initiatives and merger synergies reduced costs of goods sold per barrel by and offset approximately half of the total inflation cost increases during the year. cost of goods sold per barrel increased by . to . per barrel in from . per barrel in . the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by higher freight diesel fuel packaging materials and utilities costs. inflation alone would have accounted for an increase of approximately in cost of goods per barrel. however these unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable cost trends from supply chain cost management labor productivity and merger synergies. marketing general and administrative expenses marketing general and administrative expenses increased

item . other income expense net other expense net in includes primarily foreign exchange losses while the other income net in includes primarily foreign exchange gains. liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities external borrowings and asset monetizations. as of december and december we had working capital deficits of . million and . million respectively. we commonly operate at working capital deficits given the relatively quick turnover of our receivables and inventory. decreased current liabilities accounted for most of the decrease in working capital deficit for versus especially with regard to the current portion of longterm debt and discontinued operations. current portion of longterm debt at december and december was . million and . million respectively balances which reflect significant repayments during . we had total cash of . million at december compared to . million at december . the higher balances at yearend reflect excess cash accumulated following the repayment during of debt obligations eligible for normal scheduled repayment. longterm debt was . million and . million at december and december respectively. remaining debt as of the end of consists primarily of bonds with longerterm maturities. we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. however our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products which could arise from competitive circumstances a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages or any of the other factors we describe in item a. risk factors. operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of . million for the weeks ended december improved by . million from the week period ending december . net income was higher by . million in versus the reasons for which are discussed in detail in the results of operations discussion in this section. however much of the improvement in operating cash flow from to was due to a number of unfavorable items in . cash paid for income taxes was lower by . million during versus . during the second quarter of we made a million canadian tax payment that was driven by the merger a onetime liquidity event that was not repeated in . our pension funding in was lower by . million primarily due to a special voluntary funding to the u.s. plan in . mergerrelated costs of million were paid out subsequent to the merger in the first quarter of by our molson business in canada costs which had been accrued on the opening balance sheet as of the merger date representing a unique cash outflow not experienced in . we also made payments to officers under change in control and severance agreements of million in . the remaining improvement in operating cash flow from to is due primarily to molsons canadian business being included in for the full weeks versus weeks in given the merger date of february . we believe that our cash flow from operating activities in is more indicative of future performance than the comparable period of given the number of unusual cash outflows occurring in . coincident with the sale of the memphis brewery in september we have incurred a . million liability for the estimated payment required for our withdrawal from the hourly workers multiemployer pension plan. we expect to pay approximately . million through monthly installments in late and and then pay the remaining . million in one lump sum payment in september . our net cash provided by operating activities in was million a decrease of million from . the addition of molsons canadian beer business made a significant positive contribution to our operating cash flow. however there were several items that offset this increase. first in early we made a million canadian tax payment triggered by the merger but previously deferred by molson. our total tax expense for the year was only million and there were additional tax payments to other governmental authorities in addition to the million. second we funded million into our defined benefit pension plans in the united states canada and the united kingdom compared with expense associated with these plans of million. finally operating cash flow in also diminished because of unfavorable operating profit in the europe segment and severance and change in control payments to officers who departed the company following the merger. investing activities net cash used in investing activities of . million for the year ended december was lower by . million compared to the same period in . additions to properties were higher in by . million as compared to due primarily to spending in canada and the u.s. related to the buildout of the moncton new brunswick and shenandoah virginia breweries. in we recognized proceeds of . million on the sale of of the kaiser business in brazil offset by . million of transaction costs. in december we collected proceeds of . million as a result of the exercise of our put option related to our remaining ownership of the kaiser business in brazil. proceeds from sales of properties and intangible assets were lower by . million year over year. proceeds included a significant collection of a note related to a sale of property in the u.k. causing proceeds to exceed levels which included the sale of the memphis plant in the u.s. and various real estate sales in the u.k. on june as part of a general refinancing of the montral canadiens hockey team the club molson sold its preferred equity interest in the montral canadiens hockey club to entities which control and own a majority interest in the club. total proceeds coincident with the transaction were cad . million usd . million. we retain a . common equity interest in the club as well as board representation. the transaction structure is consistent with our long term commitment to the team and its success and helps to ensure the teams long term presence in montral. net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in . capital expenditures were higher by million in due to the inclusion of molsons canada segment capital expenditures of million following the merger and spending in the united states related to the buildout of the shenandoah facility to a full brewery. we also spent . million in to acquire creemore springs a small brewery in canada and spent . million on transaction costs associated with the merger. these factors were offset by the favorable impact of acquiring . million in cash with the merger the collection of a . million note receivable related to a sale of real estate in the u.k. and collecting a net million on trade loan activity in the u.k. cash used in investing activities in which was prior to the merger reflected capital expenditures of the u.s. and europe segments only proceeds from the sale of kegs in the u.k. and sales of real estate in both the u.s. and u.k. and a pension settlement received in from the former owners of cbl. also we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of as a result of the implementation of fin r. financing activities our debt position significantly affects our financing activity. see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a summary of our debt position at december and december . net cash used for financing activities was . million for compared to . million of cash used in financing activities during . net repayments of debt were approximately . million for encompassing all activity in our various debt and credit facilities including those associated with discontinued operations. net repayments of debt during were approximately . million including those associated with discontinued operations. the increased levels of debt repayment were due primarily to higher level of operating cash flows generated by the business in versus . proceeds from stock option exercises in were . million exceeding exercises by . million. proceeds in were impacted by significant exercises of stock options during the fourth quarter. net cash used in financing activities was . million in compared to . million in . during we paid dividends to stockholders of . million compared to . million in as a result of increased shares outstanding and a revised dividend policy following the merger. the large increase in our balance sheet debt from million at year end to million at yearend was largely the result of the assumption of molsons outstanding debt as of the merger date february . this debt assumed included borrowings molson incurred prior to the merger to pay the special dividends on molson stock before the merger. substantially all of our debt pay down occurred after the merger date. also we collected approximately million less cash in versus as a result of stock option exercises. capital resources see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing including lines of credit. the vast majority of our remaining debt borrowings as of december consist of publicly traded notes totaling . million principal amount with maturities ranging from to . our remaining debt other than the notes consists of various notes payable of . million at consolidated joint ventures which mature in and . while we will continue to use commercial paper borrowings if necessary to manage our liquidity through our periods of lower operating cash flow in early we expect to reach a point in mid when we will need to consider different alternatives for the use of cash generated. we expect to take a balanced approach to our alternatives in and beyond which could include funding of defined benefit pension plans prepayments of consolidated joint venture debt obligations modest purchases of company stock and preserving cash flexibility for potential growth investments. any purchases of mcbc stock on the open market would require a boardapproved plan which does not currently exist. in august the available amount of the . billion revolving multicurrency bank credit facility was reduced to million and the expiration date was extended to august . at december there were no borrowings outstanding against the facility. there were no other significant changes in our short or longterm borrowings. credit rating as of february our credit rating with standard poors and moodys with regard to our longterm debt was bbb and baa respectively. if the long term debt ratings were to drop consequently affecting our short term rating our access to the commercial paper market for shorter term borrowings could be unfavorably impacted resulting in either higher interest rates or an inability to borrow through commercial paper at all. we had no commercial paper borrowings at december . capital expenditures in we spent approximately . million including approximately . million spent at consolidated joint ventures on capital improvement projects worldwide. of this approximately was in support of the u.s. segment with the remainder split between the canadian european and corporate segments. the capital expenditure plan for is expected to be approximately million including approximately million of spending by consolidated joint ventures. capital spending is expected to be lower than primarily due to the planned completion of the shenandoah brewery in early . our cbl business uses kegs managed by a logistics provider who is responsible for providing an adequate stock of kegs as well as their upkeep. due to greater than anticipated keg losses as well as reduced fill fees attributable to reduced overall volume the logistics provider has encountered financial difficulty. as a result of action taken by the logistics providers lending institution related to perceived financial difficulties of the borrower the logistics provider has been forced into administration restructuring proceedings and the bank on february exercised its option to put the keg population to cbl. as a result we expect to purchase the existing keg population from the logistics providers lender at fair value pursuant to the terms of the agreement between cbl and the logistics providers lender. we estimate that this potential capital expenditure which may be financed over a period of time in excess of one year could amount to approximately million to million which is not included in the capital expenditures plan of million provided above. as a result of this capital requirement we may reduce other elements of our capital expenditures plan or offset risk posed by the potential keg purchase

and the united kingdom and million of voluntary contributions in the united states. we anticipate making approximately million of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in . consolidated pension expense was million in a decrease of million from . decreases in the u.s. and u.k. of million and million respectively were attributable mainly to higher expected returns on plan assets in and a pension curtailment in the u.k. as a result of employee restructuring activities associated with the europe segment supply chain operations a pension curtailment was recognized in the second quarter of . the curtailment triggered a remeasurement of the pension assets and liabilities as of april . additionally as a result of the curtailment a gain of . million was recognized and presented as a special item in the statement of operations in the second quarter of . this gain arose from the reduction in estimated future working lifetimes of plan participants resulting in the acceleration of the recognition of a prior service benefit. this prior service benefit was generated by plan changes in previous years and was deferred on the balance sheet and amortized into earnings over the then expected working lifetime of plan participants of approximately years. in addition this curtailment event required a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets which resulted in an . million reduction in the projected benefit obligation at april see note to the consolidated financial statements in item which was recognized in other comprehensive income in

for example litigation or claims relating to past performance. such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. see note to the consolidated financial statements in item under the captions environmental indemnity obligationssale of kaiser and montral canadiens. offbalance sheet arrangements as of december we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation sk. outlook for canada segment consistent with our objective to be a brandled company we have continued to build a consumerpreferred portfolio. our strategic brands grew at midsingledigit rates during led by the continuation of doubledigit growth from coors light and our partner import portfolio. this represents the seventh straight quarter of volume and share growth for coors light across all sales regions in canada. rickards also has continued its solid growth trend delivering doubledigit growth. we will leverage this momentum by applying a range of national and local programs to drive revenue growth in . our results for will face a challenging comparison late this year as we cycle the additional week of sales volume and corresponding profit in canada. with regard to costs in canada we continue to pursue and achieve the original merger synergy targets and the development of the next phase of our cost reduction initiatives. these synergies and other cost savings successfully offset about half of our cost inflation in canada in . while we expect to continue to reduce the impact of inflation in with synergies and other cost savings cost of goods sold is expected to increase at a lowsingledigit rate per barrel in local currency. the increase is due to slightly higher expected labor expenses lower foreign exchange benefits associated with usddenominated costs of goods inputs and the impact of cycling nonrecurring noncash fourth quarter benefits. in addition to packaging materials waste reduction plant productivity and distribution savings we are reorganizing our selling general and administrative functions beginning in january . this reorganization initiative is focused on labor savings across all functions along with reductions in other overhead expenses. the restructuring will cost approximately million most of which will be expensed in the first quarter of and is expected to have a payback period of slightly over one year. we expect continued competitive pressure in which calls for a balanced approach between longterm strategic brand building and tactics to address shortterm competitive activity. in we redirected some of our marketing spending to price promotion particularly in ontario and qubec. in we plan to increase investment in our strategic brands driving a lowsingledigit increase in marketing and sales expenses. we will continue to implement initiatives to attack costs to help fund these investments and build the longterm brand equities necessary to be successful in the canada beer business. brewing andor distribution agreements with other brewers contribute to our revenue and profitability. miller brewing company has sued us to invalidate our licensing arrangement. we are contesting their claim and currently are in discussions with miller regarding a resolution of this dispute. however there can be no assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution. a termination of this contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our intangible asset associated with the miller arrangements which has a carrying value of approximately . million at december . during the fourth quarter of we received notification from the fosters group fosters that they intend to terminate our u.s. production arrangement with them. we contend that the termination notice is ineffective. a termination of this contract could result in an impairment of a significant portion of our distribution right intangible associated with the fosters arrangement which has a carrying value of approximately . million at december . more generally the termination of partner brand agreements would have an unfavorable impact on the profitability of the canada segment. finally the canadian dollar appreciated about in against the u.s. dollar providing a significant benefit to our fullyear earnings as measured in u.s. dollars. however if the current trend toward weakening of the canadian dollar versus the u.s. dollar continues our canada results could be negatively impacted when viewed in u.s. dollars. u.s. segment throughout the u.s. business built sales momentum by leveraging its key brand equities and taking a disciplined approach to market resulting in volume growth for coors light keystone and blue moon. these brands will remain our primary focus in along with some additional focus on developing our regional brands. in we will continue to drive sales by building our key retail account business and furthering our alignment with our distributor network. in the first quarter of we again leveraged our coors light national football league nfl sponsorship throughout the playoffs and we expect our distributors to rebuild inventories of our products in preparation for peak season and the rampup of our new shenandoah virginia brewing capacity. on the other hand we expect challenging economic conditions to continue to impact our volume trends in puerto rico. we expect our first quarter results in the u.s. to benefit from a greaterthan normal distributor inventory build from the low levels after the new years holiday. the u.s. beer price environment improved during . we have seen some progress on front line pricing in the past several months and going forward we will continue to take a disciplined approach to both front line pricing and discounting while building our core brand equities to drive growth. with regard to costs we expect continued significant inflation challenges during in our u.s. business. our first quarter cost of goods sold per barrel will increase because of higher commodity costs including aluminum and agricultural inputs partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to the combined effect of selling the memphis brewery last year and not beginning to depreciate most of the virginia brewing assets until the second quarter of this year. in response to these challenges we are striving to maximize the benefits of our longterm cost initiatives especially merger synergy savings such as the closing of the memphis brewery in september and the opening of our new brewery in virginia before peak season . nonetheless we do not currently expect the benefit of our cost initiatives to fully offset inflationary cost increases under the current outlook for commodities and other inputs. as a result we expect u.s. cost of goods to increase at a lowsingledigit rate in a somewhat smaller increase than in . if aluminum diesel fuel or other costs increase substantially it could present a significant challenge to driving u.s. profit growth in . europe segment we were very successful in reducing costs and achieved total cost savings of more than million in which were delivered well above our initial expectations and helped to offset the margin loss that our business sustained during the course of the year. this impressive work contributed substantially to our earnings performance in a very challenging market and is strengthening the competitive position of this business for the future. the competitive environment in the u.k. beer industry continues to be challenging with a difficult retail environment caused by pressure on consumer spending from increased taxes interest rates and utility prices that have collectively impacted disposable incomes. industry economics also continue to exert downward pressure on pricing driven by retailer consolidation and supplier overcapacity. the overall competitive environment in the u.k. is likely to worsen in as smoking bans are implemented in all of the country by midyear. also our cost savings opportunities are becoming smaller and more difficult to achieve versus the past two years. we have three main strategies to address these challenges first we implemented cost reduction initiatives during and will implement further initiatives during . early in we also anticipate a modest flowthrough of cost savings implemented in the first half of . cost savings will become less impactful as we lap the performance of . second we will continue to invest heavily behind our core lager brandscarling grolsch and coors fine light. we have increased advertising spending around carling as part of our new marketing campaign and have received positive consumer feedback to our outdoor and television advertising. in we continued to expand carling c including a launch into the u.k. offpremise channel in the fourth quarter. c is a midstrength lager that meets changing consumer preferences and lifestyles. third at retail we continue to roll out our new colddispense technologies and distinctive abovebar fonts. this rollout extends our cold platform beyond carling for a broad group of our strategic brands as we aim to maintain our leadership in cold dispense. this leading retail innovation is driving sales with current retailers along with increased distribution via new retail outlets. during we installed cold dispense points and have seen positive results in those outlets. we face an onpremise smoking ban in three of our markets beginning in in wales on april nd in northern ireland on april th and in england on july st. we expect them to be detrimental to the onpremise channel in the short term but potentially to increase the size of the off premise market as smokers adjust to the ban. this shift to the lowermargin offpremise channel likely will offset only a portion of the negative onpremise volume and profit impact so the overall impact on volume and margin will still be negative in . our experience in other markets has been that onpremise sales usually recover at least partially in the years following the implementation of a local smoking ban. as a part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts across the organization we expect to incur restructuring costs of approximately million in . these costs which largely relate to employee severance are expected to have a payback period of approximately one and a half years. industry pricing continues to be the most important source of margin pressure in the u.k. beer business in both the on and offpremise. the u.k. business is managing pricing by channel in the context of local competition while staying focused on our core strategy of building strong brands for the long term. corporate we expect corporate marketing general and administrative costs to be to or to million lower in partially resulting from aggressive cost reductions which began in the latter part of contributing to million of cost savings in . in addition we anticipate also benefiting from the elimination of approximately million of costs due to severance payments high legal fees that are not expected to repeat in and the elimination of certain incentive compensation plans and lower expected payments for ongoing plans. approximately million of costs that are in direct support of the operating segments will transfer into the respective segments in with the majority transferring to the u.s. segment. these cost reductions will be offset partially by increased spending related to investments in projects designed to deliver cost reductions across all business segments. goodwill because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of our three segments the fair value of the applicable reporting unit was compared to its carrying value during the third quarter of to determine whether there was goodwill impairment. most of the goodwill associated with the u.s. and canada segments originated in the merger. similarly we tested indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment during the third quarter of most of which relate to our canada and europe segments. a portion of the merger goodwill was allocated to the u.s. segment based on the level of merger synergy savings expected to accrue to the u.s. segment over time. our testing during the third quarter of indicated that the fair values of the reporting units in the u.s. and canada exceeded their carrying values resulting in no impairments of goodwill in . however a reduction in the fair value of the u.s. or canada segment in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. we also have significant indefinitelived intangible assets in canada associated primarily with core noncore and partner beer brands as well as distribution rights. these intangible assets were also evaluated for impairment during the third quarter of and we determined that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. a reduction in the fair values of these intangibles could lead to impairment charges in the future. reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons including cost increases due to inflation an unfavorable beer pricing environment declines in industry or companyspecific beer volume sales termination of brewing andor distribution agreements with other brewers. the goodwill associated with the europe segment originated in the purchase of the cbl business by coors. our testing during the third quarter of indicated that the fair value of the cbl reporting unit exceeded its carrying value resulting in no impairments of goodwill. however a slight reduction in the fair value of the cbl reporting unit in the future could lead to goodwill impairment. we also have a significant indefinitelived intangible asset in europe associated with the carling brand which was also tested in the third quarter of and no impairment was warranted. future reductions in the fair value of the europe business or of specific intangibles could occur for a number of reasons including cost increases due to inflation an unfavorable beer pricing environment and declines in industry or companyspecific beer volume sales which could result in possible impairment of these assets. interest we estimate that corporate interest expense in will be approximately to million excluding u.k. trade loan interest income. tax our tax rate is volatile and may fluctuate with changes in among other things the amount of income or loss our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and changes in tax laws. on february the canadian government enacted a tax technical correction bill that will result in a onetime noncash income tax benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of . as a result we anticipate that our effective tax rate on income will be in the range of to . absent this tax law change and resulting benefit and with no other changes in tax laws or company tax structure we would expect that our effective tax rate would be in the range of to . we note however that there are other pending tax law changes in canada that if enacted would result in further reductions in the range of our effective tax rate. other the company anticipates that expense related to depreciation and amortization of assets will decline approximately in versus excluding special items due to the net effect of five factors substantial existing assets will have been fully depreciated so expense related to these assets is expected to be significantly lower in than . sale of the memphis brewery in september eliminates depreciation expense for this facility including approximately million of accelerated depreciation in to reduce the facilitys carrying value to equal its salvage value. adding packaging capacity in our toronto and virginia facilities during and brewing capacity in our virginia facility in the first half of . we are evaluating the estimated useful lives of a substantial portion of our property plant and equipment on a global basis in light of improvements in maintenance new technology and changes in expected patterns of usage. we expect this evaluation to result in an adjustment of useful livesfavorably and unfavorablyfor a wide range of existing assets. installing cold dispense units in pubs and restaurants in the u.k. changes to our capital spending plans or other changes in our asset base could alter this forward view of depreciation expense. critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or u.s. gaap. we review our accounting policies on an ongoing basis. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. by their nature estimates are subject to uncertainty. actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in canada the united states and the united kingdom. we also have postretirement welfare plans in canada and the united states that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards no. employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no. employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas . these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses salary increases inflation health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. see discussion below regarding the adoption of sfas no. employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitsan amendment of fasb statements no. and r. we performed an analysis of high quality corporate bonds at the end of and compared the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in canada the united states and the united kingdom

be estimated. we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. as additional information becomes available we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates. costs that extend the life increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of companyowned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. we also expense legal costs as incurred. see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our contingencies environmental and litigation reserves at december . we sold of the kaiser business in january and divested our remaining ownership interest by exercising a put option in november . while we reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction we retained risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax labor and civil contingencies in general. these are referenced in the section called contingencies above and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item . we account for these indemnity obligations at fair value in accordance with fasb interpretation no. fin guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. this rule requires us to carry the guarantee liability on the balance sheet at its fair value. we do not amortize these liabilities but rather make periodic estimates of their fair values and record material changes in the values through discontinued operations on the statement of operations. we use multiple probabilityweighted scenarios in determining the fair values of indemnity liabilities. as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item we have recorded a fair value liability of . million related to contingencies associated with purchased tax credits based on a total exposure of . million with regard to those liabilities. our estimates assume equally likely scenarios i.e. of no payments ever occurring and a payment of the full exposure in a future year with a potential refund in a number of years following the initial payment. if our estimate were adjusted to assume a probability of some payment occurring rather than the value of the liability would increase by . million to . million. goodwill and other intangible asset valuation we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. we completed the evaluations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the third quarter of . with regard to goodwill the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values allowing us to conclude that no impairments of goodwill have occurred. with regard to our indefinitelived intangible assets the fair values of the assets also exceeded their carrying values. significant judgments and assumptions were required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. in we standardized our method for determining fair value using a combination of discounted cash flows analyses and evaluations of values derived from market comparable transactions and market earnings multiples. this represents a change from cash flow analyses used in isolation in the prior year. we believe that this consistent methodology across all reporting units and the inclusion of evidence provided through market data and comparable transactions will improves the accuracy and consistency of this analysis. our cash flow projections are based on various longrange financial and operational plans of the company and considered when necessary various scenarios both favorable and unfavorable. in discount rates used for fair value estimates for reporting units ranged from . to .. these rates are driven by among other factors the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate as well as the credit ratings and financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit. discount rates used for testing of indefinitelived intangibles ranged from to . these rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves. our reporting units operate in relatively mature beer markets where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. changes in the factors used in the estimates including the discount rates used could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units and consequently may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. derivatives and other financial instruments the following tables present a roll forward of the fair values which consists of the notional values and the marktomarket adjustments thereto of debt and derivative contracts outstanding

to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. by policy we do not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes. we record our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted incorporating fasb statements no. and sfas which we early adopted on december . such accounting is complex as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard which continues to evolve as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. these estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances however the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec are foreign currency forward contracts commodity swaps interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. see discussions also in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements in item . we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques valueatrisk and sensitivity analysis. we use valueatrisk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps. the valueatrisk methodology provides an estimate of the level of a oneday loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest ratesensitive financial instruments. the type of valueatrisk model used to estimate the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value is a variancecovariance method. the valueatrisk model assumes normal market conditions and a confidence level. there are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute valueatrisk. the computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates. the correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent oneyear period. we have excluded anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the valueatrisk calculation some of which these instruments are intended to hedge. valueatrisk is a statistical measure of risk that estimates the loss that may be experienced with a given level of confidence over a given period of time. specifically as reported herein value atrisk is the maximum expected oneday loss at confidence that is only of the time or day in is the loss expected to exceed the valueatrisk. valueatrisk is not intended to represent actual losses that may occur nor does it represent the full extent of losses that may occur. actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by valueatrisk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments hedge percentages timing and other factors. the oneday valueatrisk at confidence of our cross currency swaps was . million . million and . million at december december and december respectively. such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap. value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our intercompany loan the underlying transaction being hedged. the hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity. we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the applicable market interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. therefore actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. the following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis which reflects the impact of a

. . . income tax assumptions we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. accounting for income taxes sfas . judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our global business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. additionally our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. we have historically provided u.s. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. during we assessed our corporate financing position with respect to all our foreign subsidiaries. as a result we have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through december as permanently reinvested. under the accounting guidance of apb and sfas we recorded a tax provision benefit in the third quarter of totaling million representing the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability in our u.k. subsidiary. as of december approximately . billion of retained earnings attributable to international companies was considered to be permanently reinvested. the companys intention is to reinvest the earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. it is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. however the company believes that u.s. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any u.s. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance. in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no. accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no. fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. fin prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. fin is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements. while we have not concluded our analysis we anticipate that the adoption of fin will increase taxrelated liabilities or decrease taxrelated assets by a minimum of million which could increase upon adoption. the cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption first reflected in the first quarter of . we expect that the requirements of fin may add volatility to our effective tax rate and therefore our expected income tax expense in future periods. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. reductions to the valuation allowance related to the merger with molson or the acquisitions of cbl that relate to deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill unless the reduction was caused by a change in law in which case the adjustment would impact earnings. consolidations under fin r rmmc and rmbc are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. the cbl joint venture with grolsch was formed to provide a longterm relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the u.k. beer market. we also consolidate the financial position and results of brewers retail inc. bri which is owned by molson and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of ontario in canada. our ownership of bri is determined by our market share in the province of ontario. our market share and ownership percentage could be reduced as a result of lower trade or consolidation of certain of our competitors. during the first quarter of press reports have indicated that a certain competitor offered to purchase another competitor in the province of ontario. if this were to occur we may need to consider whether bri should continue to be consolidated in our financial statements. adoption of new accounting pronouncements fasb interpretation no. accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. in march the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. fin which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no. accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas . specifically fin provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and or method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event. accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. we adopted fin on december which resulted in an increase to properties of . million goodwill of . million minority interest of . million and liabilities of . million related to asset retirement obligations. for asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of molson inc. as of february such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by . million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date. these asset retirement obligations relate primarily to cleanup removal or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos coolants waste water oils and other contaminants contained within our manufacturing properties. the adoption of fin was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catchup adjustment of . million net of tax benefit of . million in the statement of operations. this adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related longlived assets through december . inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors credit adjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance. if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. the net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a proforma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to december and december were and respectively. sfas no. r sharebased payment statement of financial accounting standard no. r sfas r was issued in december and became effective for us in the first quarter of . sfas r requires all sharebased payments to qualified individuals including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. prior to the adoption under the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant we presented pro forma sharebased compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. we have elected to use the modified prospective application method of implementing sfas r which does not require restatement of prior periods. under the modified prospective application method awards that are granted modified or settled after adoption of sfas r are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r. unvested equityclassified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of sfas r will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas except that the fair value amounts are recognized in the statement of operations and are subject to the forfeiture provisions of sfas r. in march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. sab to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r. in particular sab provides supplemental implementation guidance on sfas r including guidance on valuation methods classification of compensation expense inventory capitalization of sharebased compensation cost income tax effects disclosures in managements discussion and analysis and several other issues. we applied the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of . sfas r requires a calculation of the apic pool balance consisting of excess tax benefits available to absorb related sharebased compensation. fasb staff position fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards fsp r which was issued on november provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards to employees. specifically this fsp allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening apic pool balance. we have adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the apic pool in the financial statements ended december . this adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements. the effect of adoption of sfas r in was an additional expense of . million pretax . million after tax or . per diluted share. the adoption of sfas r led us to evaluate different types of instruments as share based awards and we use a combination of restricted stock unit awards performance share awards deferred stock awards and limited stock appreciation rights. as of december there was . million of total unrecognized compensation cost from sharebased compensation arrangements granted under the plans related to unvested shares. this compensation is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately . years. see note to the consolidated financial statements in item . sfas no. inventory costs sfas is an amendment to arb no. chapter that became effective for us in the first quarter of . the standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage requiring immediate recognition in the period they are incurred. the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial results. sfas no. accounting changes and corrections sfas replaces apb opinion no. and sfas and became effective for us in the first quarter of . the standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply accounting principle changes to prior years comparative financial statements as if the company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle. changes in depreciation amortization and depletion methods previously considered a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in estimate under sfas requiring prospective adoption. new pronouncements may contain specific implementation guidance which would supersede the requirements of sfas . the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the financial statements included herein. fasb staff position fsp no. fin application of fasb interpretation no. to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners fsp fin is an amendment to fin requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. the fsp is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified beginning in the first quarter of . we currently do not maintain arrangements with minimum revenue guarantees that have a significant impact on our financial statements. sfas no. employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitsan amendment of fasb statements no. and r sfas was issued in september and is effective for our annual fiscal year ending december . the standard which is an amendment to sfas and r requires an employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension andor other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. funded status is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets if any for other post retirement benefit plans. sfas also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. as a result of the adoption of sfas liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans increased by million and our accumulated other comprehensive income net of related deferred income taxes decreased by approximately million as of december . a portion of the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to the adoption of sfas will be recognized into the statement of income as a component of net period pension benefit cost. such amount will be approximately . million before tax in . see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item for a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of sfas . in addition this statement requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at the date of their yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions. this measurement date provision will be effective for our annual year end and is unlikely to have an impact to the companys financial statements as we currently measure plan assets and obligations as of our fiscal yearend. sec staff accounting bulletin no. considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements the sec issued sab in september and it is effective for our fiscal year. sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. the rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year statement of operations. thus this approach ignores the effects of correcting the portion of the current period balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior periods. the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current period irrespective of the misstatements periods of origin. financial statements would be required to be adjusted when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material. correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended. our adoption of sab did not impact the financial statements presented herein. new accounting pronouncements sfas no. accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas was issued in february and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. among other factors sfas simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements. sfas no. accounting for servicing of financial assetsan amendment of fasb statement no. sfas was issued in february and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. the new standard which is an amendment to sfas will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities by addressing the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities and providing an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedgelike accounting. we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements. fasbs emerging issue task force issue no. how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation in june the fasb ratified a consensus on the eitf issue no. eitf related to the classification of certain sales value added and excise taxes within the income statement. this eitf would become effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year . we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a significant impact on our financial statements. fasb interpretation no. accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no. in july the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no. fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. fin prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. fin is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements. while we have not concluded our analysis we anticipate that the adoption of fin will increase taxrelated liabilities or decrease taxrelated assets by a minimum of million and could increase upon adoption. the cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption first reflected in the first quarter of . we expect that the requirements of fin may add volatility to our effective tax rate and therefore our expected income tax expense in future periods. sfas no. fair value measurements sfas was issued in september and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. this standard clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. we are still in the process of reviewing the impact if any that sfas will have on our financial statements. sfas no. the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. including an amendment of fasb statement no. in february the fasb issued statement no. sfas . sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. the objective of this statement is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement techniques. the fair value measurement provisions are elective and can be applied to individual financial instruments. sfas requires additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included in the entitys financial statements. this statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year. we have not yet determined if we will elect to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of this statement and what impacts such adoption might have on our financial statements. related party transactions transactions with management and others we employ members of the coors and molson families who collectively owned of the voting a shares common and exchangeable stock of the company after the merger and throughout . hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the company. as of december various coors family trusts collectively owned approximately of our class a common and exchangeable stock approximately of our class b common and exchangeable stock and approximately of graphic packaging corporations gpc common stock. certain business relationships we purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from gpc a related party. our payments under the gpc packaging agreement in and totaled . million . million and . million respectively. related accounts payable balances included in affiliates accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets were . million and . million at december and december respectively. item a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials. we have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. by policy we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation. our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. to achieve this objective we enter into foreign currency forward contracts commodity swaps interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. we do not hedge the value of net investments in foreigncurrencydenominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. our primary foreign currency exposures are canadian dollar cad british pound sterling gbp or and japanese yen jpy. derivatives are either exchangetraded instruments or overthecounter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. no losses on overthecounter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. all overthecounter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than a standard poors or a moodys. in some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. at december no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. details of all other marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments including their fair values are included in the table below. these

offering. the bond forward transaction effectively established in advance the yield of the government of canada bond rates over which the companys private placement was priced. at the time of the private placement offering and pricing the government of canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the companys interest rate lock. this resulted in a loss of . million on the bond forward transaction. per fas accounting the loss will be amortized over the life of the canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the companys effective cost of borrowing by . basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. simultaneouslywith the u.s. private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire usd million issue amount and for the same maturity. in this transaction we exchanged our million for a cad . million obligation with a third party. the terms of the transaction are such that the company will pay interest at a rate of . to the third party on the amount of cad . million and will receive interest at a rate of . on the million amount. there was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. we have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the usd securities. consistent with fas accounting all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of operations and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. the bri joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps converting cad million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in . there was no exchange of principal at the

significant accounting policies on february adolph coors company merged with molson inc. the merger. in connection with the merger adolph coors company became the parent of the merged company and changed its name to molson coors brewing company. unless otherwise noted in this report any description of us includes molson coors brewing company mcbc or the company principally a holding company and its operating subsidiaries coors brewing company cbc operating in the united states u.s. coors brewers limited cbl operating in the united kingdom u.k. molson canada molson operating in canada and our other corporate entities. any reference to coors means the adolph coors company prior to the merger. any reference to molson inc. means molson prior to the merger. any reference to molson coors means mcbc after the merger. unless otherwise indicated information in this report is presented in u.s. dollars usd or . our fiscal year our fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last sunday in december. the fiscal year ended december was a week period and fiscal years ended december and december were week periods. principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majorityowned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries as well as entities consolidated under fasb interpretation no. r consolidation of variable interest entitiesan interpretation of arb fin r. all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. reporting periods presented the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include the results of molson and kaiser presented as a discontinued operation prior to the merger on february . further the results of kaiser and our joint venture brewers retail inc. bri consolidated under fin r are reported one month in arrears since the date of the merger for this and future reporting periods. for the year ended december kaisers results include the results for december through january the date of the sale and for the year ended december kaisers results include the results for february the date of the merger through november . for the year ended december bris results include the results for february the date of the merger through november . use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states u.s. gaap. these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions. we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available at the time they are made. to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements may be affected. reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the and financial statements to conform to the presentation. revenue recognition depending upon the method of distribution revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or distributor which is either at the time of shipment to distributors or upon delivery of product to retail customers. in canada revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or distributor which is either at the time of shipment to distributors or upon delivery of product to retail customers. in the united states customers are principally independent distributors or wholesalers. revenue is recognized when product is shipped and the risk of loss transfers to the distributors or wholesalers. revenue is recognized in the europe segment when product is received by our customers who are principally independent retailers in the united kingdom. in the united kingdom excise taxes are included in the purchase price we pay the vendor on beverages for the factored brands business purchased from third parties for resale and are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. in all segments the cost of various programs such as price promotions rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of sales. sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. revenue is stated net of incentives discounts and returns. outside of unusual circumstances if product is returned it is generally for failure to meet our quality standards not caused by customer actions. products that do not meet our high quality standards are returned and destroyed. we do not have standard terms that permit return of product. we estimate the costs for product returns and record those costs in cost of goods sold each period. we reduce revenue at the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is returned. cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold includes beer raw materials packaging materials including promotional packaging manufacturing costs plant administrative support and overheads inbound and outbound freight charges purchasing and receiving costs inspection costs warehousing and internal transfer costs. equity method accounting we generally apply the equity method of accounting to to owned investments where we exercise significant influence except for certain joint ventures that must be consolidated as variable interest entities under fin r. these investments primarily involve equity ownership in transportation services in our europe segment tradeteam and an investment in the montral canadiens in canada. there are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments as of december . marketing general and administrative expenses our marketing general and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising sales staff costs and nonmanufacturing administrative and overhead costs. the creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. production costs are generally expensed when the advertising is first run. advertising expense was . million . million and . million for years and respectively. prepaid advertising costs of . million . million in current and . million in longterm and . million . million in current and . million in longterm were included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at december and december respectively. trade loans cbl extends loans to retail outlets that sell our brands. some of these loans provide for no interest to be payable and others provide for payment of a below market interest rate. in return the retail outlets receive smaller discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased from us with the net result being cbl attaining a market return on the outstanding loan balance. we therefore reclassify a portion of beer revenue into interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. in and this amount was . million . million and . million respectively. we have included this interest income in the europe segment since it is related solely to cbl. trade loan receivables are classified as either other receivables or noncurrent notes receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. at december and december total loans outstanding net of allowances were . million and . million respectively. allowance for doubtful accounts canadas distribution channels are highly regulated by provincial regulation and experience few collectibility problems. however canada does have direct sales to retail customers for which an allowance is recorded based upon expected collectibility and historical experience. in the u.s. segment our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the u.s. segment accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom collection occurs through electronic funds transfer. also in the united states we secure substantially all of our product sale credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds personal guarantees and other letters of credit. because the majority of cbl sales are directly to retail customers and because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. at cbl we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. generally provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer at the point the account is considered uncollectible. accounts are typically deemed uncollectible based on the sales channel after becoming either one hundred and twenty days or one hundred eighty days overdue. we record the provision in marketing general and administrative expenses. provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or at the point an account is written off. we are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables and trade loans could be materially affected. inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the firstin firstout fifo method in europe and canada and on the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all inventories in the united states. current cost in the united states determined on the fifo method exceeded lifo cost by . million and . million at december and december respectively. we regularly assess the shelflife of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications. fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the shortterm maturity of these instruments. the fair value of longterm obligations for derivatives was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using market interest rates. assuming current market rates for similar instruments the fair value of longterm debt exceeds the carrying value by approximately . million and . million at december and december respectively. foreign currency translation assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income. factored brands in addition to supplying our own brands cbl sells other beverage companies products to onpremise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. these factored brand sales are included in our financial results but the related volume is not included in our reported sales volumes. we refer to this as the factored brand business. in the factored brand business cbl normally purchases factored brand inventory taking orders from customers for such brands and invoicing customers for the product and related costs of delivery. in accordance with eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent sales under the factored brands are generally reported on a gross income basis. however cbls relationship with a large onpremise customer changed in resulting in net reporting of sales and cost of sales as an agent for that customer in our consolidated statement of operations on a prospective basis from the date of change in our contract terms. the change in accounting recognition from gross to net reporting reflects a change in the substance of cbls status as transaction agent whereby there has been a transfer of credit risk from cbl to the owner and supplier of the factored brands effective in . goodwill and other intangible asset valuation we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. see note . statement of cash flows data cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of days or less. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. the following presents our supplemental cash flow information for the fiscal years ended december december december in millions cash paid for interest. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . cash paid for taxes. . . . . .

accounting pronouncements fasb interpretation no. accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. in march the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no. fin which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no. accounting for asset retirement obligations. sfas specifically fin provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and or method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event. accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. we adopted fin on december which resulted in an increase to properties of . million goodwill of . million minority interest of . million and liabilities of . million related to asset retirement obligations. for asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of molson inc. as of february such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by . million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date. these asset retirement obligations relate primarily to cleanup removal or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos coolants waste water oils and other contaminants contained within our manufacturing properties. the adoption of fin was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catchup adjustment of . million net of tax benefit of . million in the statement of operations. this adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related longlived assets through december . inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts inflation factors credit adjusted discount rates timing of settlement and changes in the legal regulatory environmental and political environments. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance. if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement. the net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a proforma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to december and december were and respectively. sfas no. r sharebased payment sfas r was issued in december and became effective for us in the first quarter of . sfas r requires all sharebased payments to qualified individuals including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as compensation cost in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. prior to the adoption under the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant we presented pro forma sharebased compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. we have elected to use the modified prospective application method of implementing sfas r which does not require restatement of prior periods. under the modified prospective application method awards that are granted modified or settled after adoption of sfas r are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r. unvested equityclassified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of sfas r will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas except that the fair value amounts are recognized in the statement of operations and are subject to the forfeiture provisions of sfas r. in march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. sab to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r. in particular sab provides supplemental implementation guidance on sfas r including guidance on valuation methods classification of compensation expense inventory capitalization of sharebased compensation cost income tax effects disclosures in managements discussion and analysis and several other issues. we applied the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of . sfas r requires a determination of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share based compensation. fasb staff position r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards fsp r which was issued on november provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards to employees. specifically this fsp allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening balance. we have adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the excess tax benefits. this adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements. the effect of adoption of sfas r in was an additional expense of . million pretax . million after tax or . per diluted share. see note . the following table illustrates the pro forma effects for the years ended december and december if the company followed the fair value provisions of sfas r during such periods year

requiring immediate recognition in the period they are incurred. the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial results. sfas no. accounting changes and corrections sfas replaces apb opinion no. and sfas and became effective for us in the first quarter of . the standard introduces a new requirement to retrospectively apply accounting principle changes to prior years comparative financial statements as if the company had always applied the newly adopted accounting principle. changes in depreciation amortization and depletion methods previously considered a change in accounting principle are now considered a change in estimate under sfas requiring prospective adoption. the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the financial statements included herein. fasb staff position fsp no. fin application of fasb interpretation no. to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners fsp fin is an amendment to fin requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount. the fsp is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified beginning in the first quarter of . we currently do not maintain arrangements with minimum revenue guarantees that have a significant impact on our financial statements. sfas no. employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitsan amendment of fasb statements no. and r sfas was issued in september and is effective for our annual fiscal year ending december . the standard which is an amendment to sfas and r requires an employer to recognize the funded status of any defined benefit pension andor other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. funded status is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets if any for other post retirement benefit plans. sfas also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. as a result of the adoption of sfas liabilities related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans increased by million and our accumulated other comprehensive income net of related deferred income taxes decreased by approximately million as of december . a portion of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the adoption of sfas will be recognized in the statement of operations as a component of net periodic pension benefit cost in future periods. such amount is estimated to be approximately . million before tax in . see notes and for a detailed discussion regarding the adoption of sfas . in addition this statement requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at the date of their yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions. this measurement date provision will be effective for our annual year end and will not have an impact on the companys financial statements as we currently measure plan assets and

misstatements in current year financial statements the sec issued sab in september and it is effective for our fiscal year. sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. the rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement. thus this approach ignores the effects of correcting the portion of the current period balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior periods. the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current period irrespective of the misstatements periods of origin. financial statements would be required to be adjusted when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material. correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended. our adoption of sab did not impact the financial statements presented herein. new accounting pronouncements sfas no. accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas was issued in february and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. among other factors sfas simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value accounting for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. we do not expect that sfas will have an impact on our financial statements. sfas no. accounting for servicing of financial assetsan amendment of fasb statement no. sfas was issued in february and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. the new standard which is an amendment to sfas will simplify the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities by addressing the recognition and measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities and providing an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedgelike accounting. we do not expect that

income statement that is gross versus net presentation in june the fasb ratified a consensus on the eitf issue no. eitf related to the classification of certain sales value added and excise taxes

accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no. fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. fin prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. fin is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements. while we have not concluded our analysis we anticipate that the adoption of fin will increase taxrelated liabilities or decrease taxrelated assets by a minimum of million and could increase upon adoption. the cumulative effect of applying the new requirement will be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption first reflected in the first quarter of . we expect that the requirements of fin may add volatility to our effective tax rate and therefore our expected income tax expense in future periods. sfas no. fair value measurements sfas was issued in september and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year. this standard clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. we are still in the process of reviewing the impact if any that sfas will have on our financial statements. sfas no. the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. including an amendment of fasb statement no. in february the fasb issued statement no. sfas . sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. the objective of this statement is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities using different measurement techniques. the fair value measurement provisions are elective and can be applied to individual financial instruments. sfas requires additional disclosures related to the fair value measurements included in the entitys financial statements. this statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our fiscal year. we have not yet determined if we will elect to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of this statement and what impacts such adoption might have on our financial statements. . molson merger merger transaction on february the merger

equity interest in our brazilian unit cervejarias kaiser brasil s.a. kaiser to femsa cerveza s.a. de c.v. femsa for million cash less . million of transaction costs including the assumption by femsa of kaiserrelated debt and certain contingencies. kaiser represented our previouslyreported brazil operating segment that we acquired on february as part of the merger. we retained a interest in kaiser throughout most of which we accounted for under the cost method and had one seat out of seven on its board. another brewer held a equity interest in the kaiser business at the time of this transaction. as part of the sale we also received a put option to sell to femsa our remaining interest in kaiser for the greater of . million or fair market value through january and at fair market value thereafter. the value of the put option favorably impacted the calculation of the loss on the sale of kaiser recorded in the first quarter of . during the fourth quarter of we exercised the put option on our remaining interest which had a carrying value of million at the time of the sale and received a cash payment of . million including . million of accrued interest presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows as an inflow from investing activities. as a result we have no ownership interest remaining in kaiser as of december . we sold kaiser to allow us to focus on our canada united states and europe markets. prior to the acquisition of of kaiser femsa was and remains the largest distributor of kaiser products in brazil. we have reflected the results of operations financial position and cash flows for the former brazil segment in our financial statements as discontinued operations. the terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify femsa for exposures related to certain tax civil and labor contingencies arising prior to femsas purchase of kaiser see note . we provided a full indemnity for any losses kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with certain previously utilized tax credits. the total base amount of potential claims in this regard plus estimated accumulated penalties and interest was million on the date of sale. as of december we have recorded the fair value of this indemnity liability on the balance sheet at . million. our indemnity obligations related to previously purchased tax credits increased by . million during the fourth quarter as a result of the exercise of the put option. we also provided indemnity related to all other tax civil and labor contingencies existing at the date of sale. in this regard however femsa assumed its full share of all contingent liabilities that had been previously recorded and disclosed by us up to a maximum of million. we may have to provide indemnity to femsa if those contingencies settle at amounts greater than those amounts previously recorded or disclosed by us. we will be able to offset any indemnity exposures in these circumstances with amounts that settle favorably to amounts previously recorded. as of december we have recorded the fair value of this indemnity liability at . million. our indemnity obligations related to tax civil and labor claims increased by . million during the fourth quarter as a result of the exercise of the put option. the recognition of and changes in the liabilities associated with the indemnifications impacted the loss on the sale of brazil and future changes thereto will impact future reported results for discontinued operations. see note for a more detailed discussion of these items as well as a rollforward of the

effective tax rate was significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the following lower income tax rates applicable to our canadian and u.k. businesses and one time benefits from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions in foreign income tax rates. our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to lower income tax rates applicable to our canadian and u.k. businesses and a one time benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously recognized deferred tax liability due to our election to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through december as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of apb accounting for income taxesspecial areasapb and sfas accounting for income taxessfas . the company has u.s. federal and state net operating losses. the tax effect of these attributes is . million at december and . million at december . the company believes that a portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to these loss carryforwards will more likely than not not be realized and has established a valuation allowance in the amount of . million and zero at december and december respectively. the change in valuation allowance from december to december is attributable to anticipated changes in state tax apportionment due to shutting down our memphis brewing facility and other changes in our u.s. operations. in addition the company has canadian federal and provincial net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. the tax effect of these attributes is million at december and . million at december . the canadian capital loss carryforwards do not have a limit in time to be used and the canadian net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through . the company believes that a portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to the canadian loss carryforwards will more likely than not not be realized and has established a valuation allowance in the amount of . million and . million at december and december respectively. in addition the company has u.k. capital loss carryforwards. the tax effect of these attributes was . million at december and . million at december . the u.k. capital loss carryforwards do not have a limit in time to be used however the company believes that the deferred tax asset associated with these u.k. loss carryforwards will more likely than not not be realized and has established a valuation allowance for the full amount . million and . million at december and december respectively. the change in amounts from december to december is attributable to changes in the foreign exchange rate. annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns however the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues may differ materially from the amount accrued. see note for discussion regarding future adoption of fin . we have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through december as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of apb and sfas . as of december approximately . billion of retained earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely invested. the companys intention is to reinvest the indefinitely invested earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. it is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. however the company believes that u.s. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any u.s. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance. on february the canadian government enacted a tax technical correction bill that will result in an income tax benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of . the tax technical correction bill allows the company to release a current tax liability that was established in molsons opening balance sheet at the time of the merger. the release of this tax liability results in a onetime noncash income tax benefit to the income statement and will be accounted for discretely in the first quarter of . . special items net largely in connection with the merger and our related synergy goals we have incurred charges or gains that are not indicative of

included employee termination costs and other incremental costs that were the direct result of the memphis plant closure. the memphis plant was closed and sold during the third quarter of see below. u.s. segment special items in were partially offset by the benefit of a . million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations at the lowry superfund site in denver colorado. the cash received did not impact our estimated environmental liability associated with this site. in . million of these charges related to accelerated depreciation . million was expensed as the initial estimate of the cost required to withdraw from the memphis hourly workers multiemployer pension plan and the remaining . million included employee termination costs and other incremental costs that were the direct result of the memphis plant closure. charges for accelerated depreciation are larger in than in due to reductions in salvage value estimates of the memphis brewery and acceleration of the plants closing date. retention and severance costs for the memphis employees were expensed over the service period during which such

facility or outsourced. the memphis brewery was sold in september to an investment group led by a former employee. the memphis brewery assets were depreciated to a value that approximated the sale price therefore the loss from the final disposition of the assets and liabilities associated with memphis was insignificant. we entered into a distribution agreement with the new memphis brewery owners. management believes that the terms of the sale of the memphis plant and the new threeyear distribution agreement are market reflective armslength. europe segment the europe segment recognized . million and . million of net special items in and respectively. the net items comprised of . million of employee termination costs associated with the u.k. supply chain and back office restructuring

entire benefit was associated with the exercise price floor on stock options and excise taxes to be paid for departed officers. the charges were associated with . million of severance and other benefits paid to twelve former coors officers who exercised change in control rights . million were a result of providing an exercise price floor on stock options including additional payroll related taxes to be paid on behalf of a former coors officer that exercised stock options under the change in control agreement associated with these potential awards . million of severance and sharebased compensation and benefits paid to two former molson officers who left the company during the second quarter of following the merger and . million of mergerrelated costs that did not qualify for capitalization under purchase accounting. coors had agreements with executive officers and certain other members of management relating to a change of control of coors referred to above. the merger which occurred on february constituted a change in control of coors under these agreements. these employees were entitled to severance benefits if triggering events specified in the agreement occurred. upon a triggering event the officer would receive a multiple of annual salary and bonus and continued health pension and life insurance benefits. for terminated officers stock option exercises are subject to a floor market price equal to the price of coors stock on the date of the change of control .. this potential cash award is recorded as a liability and is marked to market each period with the change in mcbcs stock price up to the price at the date of the merger and has a five year term from february to february . when the price of the companys stock rises to the option floor it results in a reduction of this liability. to the extent the companys stock price falls below the merger price additional charges are necessary. we recorded zero and . million liability as of december and december respectively related to stock option floor. the cost or benefit associated with the stock option exercise price floor is included in the statement of cash flows as sharebased compensation as a noncash increase or decrease to net income in determining cash flows from operating activities. . stockholders equity changes to the number of shares of capital stock issued were as

outstanding stock class a and class b common and class a and class b exchangeable. exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares by class in all respects. all classes of stock have in effect the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. class a shareholders receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and paid to class b shareholders. see note for further discussion of the features of class a and b common shares and class a and b exchangeable shares. antidilutive securities totaling . million . million and . million in and respectively were not included in our calculation due to the fact that the stock options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares or were anti dilutive due to the impact of unrecognized compensation cost on the calculation of assumed proceeds in the application of the treasury stock method. the assumed proceeds calculation in the treasury stock method required us to determine windfall tax benefits. we calculated this amount by multiplying inthemoney options outstanding by a dollar amount derived by calculating the current average market price less the grant price less the blackscholes fair value amount. this product was multiplied by the appropriate tax rate. outstanding performance stock awards totaling on december were also excluded from dilutive shares in accordance with sfas earnings per share. as all necessary conditions required to be satisfied outlined in note had not been met as of the year ended december . there were no performance awards issued

paymentsstock option restricted stock and other stock awards in the first quarter of we adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no. sharebased payment sfas r. the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method of adoption which does not require restatement of prior periods. sfas r requires a determination of excess tax benefits available to absorb related share based compensation. fasb staff position r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards fsp r which was issued on november provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards to employees. specifically this fsp allows a company to elect the alternative or simplified method to calculate the opening excess tax benefits balance. we have adopted such alternative method provisions to calculate the beginning balance of the excess tax benefit in the financial statements ended december . under the new standard excess income tax benefits if any from sharebased compensation are presented as financing activities rather than operating activities in the statements of cash flows. this adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements. at december we had three stockbased compensation plans. the equity incentive plan the equity incentive plan ei plan generally provides for two types of grants stock options and restricted stock awards for our employees. the stock options have a term of years and onethird of the stock option vests in each of the three successive years after the date of grant. there were no awards granted under the companys ei plan in and we are not expecting to grant any new awards under this plan. equity compensation plan for nonemployee directors the equity compensation plan for nonemployee directors ec plan provides for awards of the companys class b shares of restricted stock or options for class b shares. awards vest after completion of the directors annual term. the compensation cost associated with the ec plan is amortized over the directors term. there were no awards granted under the companys ec plan in and we are not expecting to grant any new awards under this plan. molson coors brewing company incentive compensation plan during we issued the following awards related to class b common shares to certain directors officers and other eligible employees pursuant to the molson coors brewing company incentive compensation plan mcbc ic plan stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units performance shares and limited stock appreciation rights. stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. stock options have a term of years and generally vest over three years. restricted stock unit awards are issued at the market value equal to the price of our stock at the date of the grant and vest over the period of three years. in we granted of restricted stock units with the weightedaverage market value of . each. deferred stock units awards under the directors stock plan pursuant to the mcbc ic plan are elected by the nonemployee directors of molson coors brewing company by enabling them to receive all or onehalf of their annual cash retainer payments in our stock. the deferred stock unit awards are issued at the market value equal to the average days price on the date of the grant and generally vest over the annual service period. we granted deferred stock units with the weightedaverage market value of . each. performance share awards are earned over the estimated expected term to achieve projected financial targets established at the time of the grant. currently these financial targets are expected to be achieved by the end of our fiscal year at which point these shares will fully vest. this estimate is subject to future revisions based on the performance levels of the company. performance shares are granted at the market value of our stock at the date of the grant and have a term of five years. in shares were granted under this plan at the weightedaverage market value of . per share. on march the company issued limited stock appreciation rights to one of its key executives. these limited stock appreciation rights entitle the executive to receive shares of the companys stock with a fair market value equal to the excess of the trading price of such shares on the date of the exercise but not to exceed . and the trading price on the date of the grant or . per share. the award cannot be exercised before may and will fully vest on may . the fair value of this award of . per limited stock appreciation right as of the date of grant was determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model. the total fair value of . million at march will be recognized in the statement of operations on a straightline basis over . years the remaining . million will vest in approximately . years. the option pricing model includes certain assumptions and estimates. for the assumptions and estimates management used for this award see the table in the stock option section below. as of december there were shares of the

curtailment as a result of employee restructuring activities associated with the europe segment supply chain operations a pension curtailment was recognized in the second quarter of . the curtailment triggered a significant event that resulted in the remeasurement of the pension assets and liabilities as of april . the table below represents the projected benefit obligation and the funded status as of december the curtailment measurement date of april and the changes in their status from december for the u.k. plan. as a result of the curtailment a gain of . million was recognized and presented as a special item in the statement of operations in the second quarter of . this gain arose from the reduction in estimated future working lifetimes of plan participants resulting in the acceleration of the recognition of a prior service benefit. this prior service benefit was generated by plan changes in previous years and was deferred on the balance sheet and amortized into earnings over the then expected working lifetime of plan participants of approximately years. in addition this curtailment event required a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets which resulted in an . million reduction in the projected benefit obligation at april as shown below which was recognized in other comprehensive income in . the changes in the projected benefit

. derivative instruments market risk management policies in the normal course of business we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates the value of foreign currencies and production and packaging materials prices. we have established policies and procedures that govern the strategic management of these exposures through the use of a variety of financial instruments. by policy we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and prices. to achieve this objective we enter into foreign currency forward contracts commodity swaps interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. we do not hedge the value of net investments in foreigncurrencydenominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. our primary foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar cad the british pound sterling gbp or and the japanese yen jpy. derivatives are either exchangetraded instruments or overthecounter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. we are exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to hedging instruments and do not enter into master netting arrangements. the counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least a standard poors a moodys or better. however this does not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. to manage this risk we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines. we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries we conduct our business. as a result of the above considerations we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. in some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. at december no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. derivative accounting policies the majority of all derivatives entered into by the company qualify for and are designated as foreigncurrency cash flow hedges commodity cash flow hedges or fair value hedges including those derivatives hedging foreign currency denominated firm commitments as per the definitions of statement of financial accounting standards no. accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted incorporating fasb statements no. and sfas no. . the company considers whether any provisions in nonderivative contracts represent embedded derivative instruments as described in sfas no. . as of december we have concluded that no embedded derivative instruments warrant separate fair value accounting under sfas no. . all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets or other noncurrent assets. unrealized loss positions are recorded as other liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities. changes in unrealized gains and losses from fair value hedges are classified in the statement of operations consistent with the classification of the corresponding income or expense line item being hedged. changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedges that are highly effective as per the definition of sfas are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction. in most cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to earnings at maturity of the related derivative. the recognition of effective hedge results in the consolidated statement of income offsets the gains or losses on the underlying exposure. cash flows from derivative transactions are classified according to the nature of the risk being hedged. we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives either to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. we also formally assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. when it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively as discussed below. we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is no longer highly effective as per sfas no. in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. when we discontinue hedge accounting but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. however if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet until maturity recognizing future changes in the fair value in currentperiod earnings. any hedge ineffectiveness as per sfas no. is recorded in currentperiod earnings in other expense income net. effectiveness is assessed based on the comparison of current forward rates to the rates established on our hedges. following are the notional transaction amounts and fair values for our outstanding derivatives summarized by risk category and instrument type. for the years ended

recognized may differ favorably or unfavorably from those shown due to the fact that some of our derivative positions are not yet settled and therefore remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations. as noted effective gains and losses are deferred over time and recognized simultaneously with the impact of the underlying transactions. the ineffective gains and losses are recognized

derivative instruments held by molson that hedged currency commodity and interest rate risk in a similar manner as coors. we are a party to a cross currency swap totaling cad million approximately usd . million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in . the swap included an initial exchange of principal in and matures in . the swap also calls for an exchange of fixed cad interest payments for fixed usd interest receipts. at the initial principal exchange we paid usd to a counterparty and received cad. upon final exchange we will provide cad to the counterparty and receive usd. the cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future cad interest and principal receipts that result from changes in the usd to cad exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. in addition in september of we entered into a cross currency swap totaling gbp . million approximately usd . million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in . the swap included an initial exchange of principal in and matures in . the swap calls for an exchange of fixed gbp interest payments for fixed cad interest receipts. at the initial principal exchange we paid cad to a counterparty and received gbp. the cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future gbp interest and principal receipts that result from changes in the cad to gbp exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries. prior to issuing the notes on september see note we entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of the canadian offering. the bond forward transaction effectively established in advance the yield of the government of canada bond rates over which the companys private placement was priced. at the time of the private placement offering and pricing the government of canada bond rate was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the companys interest rate lock. this resulted in a loss of . million on the bond forward transaction. per fas accounting the loss will be amortized over the life of the canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the companys effective cost of borrowing by . basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. simultaneously with the september u.s. private placement see note we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire usd million issue amount and for the same maturity. in this transaction we exchanged our usd million for a cad . million obligation with a third party. the terms of the transaction are such that the company will pay interest at a rate of . to the third party on the amount of cad . million and will receive interest at a rate of . on the usd million amount. there was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. we have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the usd securities. consistent with fas accounting all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded in earnings and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. as of december we are a party to other cross currency swaps totaling gbp million approximately usd million at the date of entering the transaction. the swaps included an initial exchange of principal on the settlement date of our private placement fixed rate debt see note and will require final principal exchange in may . the swaps also call for an exchange of fixed gbp interest payments for fixed usd interest receipts. at the initial principal exchange we paid usd to a counterparty and received gbp. upon final exchange we will provide gbp to the counterparty and receive usd. the cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future gbp interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the usd to gbp exchange rates on an intercompany loan between our europe subsidiary and u.s. subsidiary. we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt. these interest rate swaps convert . million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in . we will receive fixed usd interest payments semiannually at a rate of per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the threemonth libor rate thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating interest rate obligation. there was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. we designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of the . million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the libor swap rates. the bri joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps converting cad . million notional amount of the cad million . fixed rate debt. the interest rate swaps convert the cad . million to floating rates and mature in . there was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. during july we entered into and designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of the cad . million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the libor swap rates. prior to the inception of this fair value hedge the interest rate swaps held by bri were the only molson inc. derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas . marktomarket changes on these interest rate swaps were recorded as interest expense. our fair value hedges effective losses gains net were . million . million and . million for the years ended december december and december respectively. as of december . million of deferred gains on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as a result of expected gains or losses on underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in earnings. actual amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings are dependent on the applicable rates in effect when derivatives contracts that are currently outstanding mature. as of december the maximum term over which we are hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for all forecasted and recorded transactions is years. . accrued expenses and

exists and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable an estimate of the future costs are recorded as a liability in the financial statements. costs that extend the life increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of companyowned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. from time to time we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. we cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup our share of the total cost the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage. we are one of a number of entities named by the environmental protection agency epa as a prp at the lowry superfund site. this landfill is owned by the city and county of denver denver and is managed by waste management of colorado inc. waste management. in we recorded a pretax charge of million a portion of which was put into a trust in as part of a settlement with denver and waste management regarding the thenoutstanding litigation. our settlement was based on an assumed remediation cost of million in adjusted dollars. we are obligated to pay a portion of future costs if any in excess of that amount. waste management provides us with updated annual cost estimates through . we reviewed these cost estimates in the assessment of our accrual related to this issue. we use certain assumptions that differ from waste managements estimates to assess our expected liability. our expected liability based on the million threshold being met is based on our best estimates available. the assumptions used are as follows trust management costs are included in projections with regard to the million threshold but are expensed only as incurred income taxes which we believe are not an included cost are excluded from projections with regard to the million threshold a . inflation rate for future costs and certain operations and maintenance costs were discounted using a . riskfree rate of return. based on these assumptions the present value and gross amount of the costs at december are approximately . million and . million respectively. accordingly we believe that the existing liability is adequate as of december . we did not assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of our liability and none are expected. considering the estimates extend through the year and the related uncertainties at the site including what additional remedial actions may be required by the epa new technologies and what costs are included in the determination of when the million threshold is reached the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. we cannot predict the amount of any such change but additional accruals in the future are possible. we are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in colorado resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities. there may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware. in october we were notified by the epa that we are a prp along with approximately other parties at the cooper drum site in southern california. certain of molsons former nonbeer business operations which were discontinued and sold in the mids prior to the merger with coors were involved at this site. we responded to the epa with information regarding our past involvement with the site. we are not yet able to estimate any potential liability associated with this site. while we cannot predict the eventual aggregate cost for environmental and related matters in which we are currently involved we believe that any payments if required for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results cash flows or our financial or competitive position. we believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. indemnity obligationssale of kaiser on january we sold a equity interest in kaiser to femsa for million in cash net of . million of transaction costs including the assumption by femsa of kaiserrelated debt and contingencies. we retained a interest in kaiser through most of and had one seat out of seven on its board. as part of the sale we also received a put option to sell to femsa our remaining interest in kaiser for the greater of . million or fair market value through january and at fair market value thereafter. during the fourth quarter of we exercised the put option on our remaining interest which had a carrying value of million at the time of the sale and as a result we have no ownership interest remaining in kaiser as of december . the terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify femsa for certain exposures related to tax civil and labor contingencies. first we provided a full indemnity for any losses kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with certain previously utilized purchased tax credits. any potential liabilities associated with these exposures were considered less than probable during and therefore no associated reserves were recorded in . the total base amount of potential claims in this regard plus estimated accumulated penalties and interest is million. as of december the fair value of this indemnity liability on the balance sheet was . million . million of which was classified as a current liability and . million of which was classified as noncurrent. our initial fair value estimates accounted for the possibility that we could have been required to pay the full amount of the exposure in a future year but that a majority of the amounts paid would be recovered in subsequent years through brazils legal system. our fair value estimates also considered through probabilityweighted scenarios the possibility that we would never have to pay any amounts associated with this exposure. our indemnity obligations related to previously purchased tax credits increased by . million during the fourth quarter of as a result of the exercise of the put option. we also provided indemnity related to all other tax civil and labor contingencies. in this regard however femsa assumed their full share of all contingent liabilities that had been previously recorded and disclosed by us prior to the sale on january . however we may have to provide indemnity to femsa if those contingencies settle at amounts greater than those amounts previously recorded or disclosed by us. we will be able to offset any indemnity exposures in these circumstances with amounts that settle favorably to amounts previously recorded. our exposure related to these indemnity claims is capped at the amount of the sales price of the equity interest of kaiser which was million. as a result of these contract provisions our fair value estimates include not only probabilityweighted potential cash outflows associated with indemnity provisions but also probabilityweighted cash inflows that could result from favorable settlements which could occur through negotiation or settlement programs that could arise from the federal or any of the various state governments in brazil. the fair value of this indemnity was favorably impacted during the third quarter of as a result of significant payments made by kaiser under certain tax amnesty programs made available by the brazilian governmental authorities resulting in significant credits to mcbc and an overall reduction in the remaining number of kaisers outstanding tax claims. the recorded fair value of the total tax civil and labor indemnity liability was million on the date of sale on january and it is recorded at . million as of december . million of which is classified as a current liability and . million of which is classified as noncurrent. the exercise of the put option on our remaining interest in kaiser increased our indemnity obligations related to tax civil and labor claims increased by . million during the fourth quarter. future settlement procedures and related negotiation activities associated with these contingencies are largely outside of our control and will be handled by femsa. the sale agreement requires annual cash settlements relating to the tax civil and labor indemnities the first of which will occur during the first half of . indemnity obligations related to purchased tax credits must be settled upon notification. due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies significant adjustments to the carrying values of the indemnity obligations could result in the future. these liabilities are denominated in brazilian reals and have been stated at present value and will therefore be subject in the future to foreign exchange gains or losses and to accretion cost both of which will be recognized in the discontinued operations section of the statement of operations. the table below provides a summary of contingency reserve balances from march

interest in the montral canadiens professional hockey club the club and prior to june molson also owned a preferred interest. on june entities which control and own a majority of the club purchased the preferred equity held by molson canada. subsequent to the transaction molson canada still retains . common equity interest in the club as well as board representation at the club and related entities. also coincident with the disposition of our preferred interest molson canada was released from a direct guarantee of the clubs debt financing. the shareholders of the club the majority owner and molson canada and the national hockey league nhl are parties to a consent agreement which requires the purchaser and molson to abide by funding requirements included in the terms of the shareholders agreement. in addition molson canada continues to be a guarantor of the majority owners obligations under a land lease. we have evaluated our risk exposure related to these financial guarantees recorded the fair values of these guarantees accordingly. litigation and other disputes beginning in may several purported class actions were filed in the united states and canada including federal courts in delaware and colorado and provincial courts in ontario and qubec alleging among other things that the company and its affiliated entities including molson inc. and certain officers and directors misled stockholders by failing to disclose first quarter januarymarch u.s. business trends prior to the merger vote in january . the colorado case has since been transferred to delaware and consolidated with those cases. one of the lawsuits filed in delaware federal court also alleges that the company failed to comply with u.s. gaap. the company will vigorously defend the lawsuits. in may the company was contacted by the central regional office of the u.s. securities and exchange commission in denver the sec requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other information from the company and molson inc. relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related to the merger the companys financial results for the first quarter of and other information. in november the company received a letter from the sec stating that this matter in the matter of molson coors brewing company da has been recommended for termination and no enforcement action has been recommended to the commission. the information in the secs letter was provided under the guidelines in the final paragraph of securities act release no. . the company was contacted by the new york stock exchange in june requesting information in connection with events leading up to the companys earnings announcement on april which was the date we announced our first quarter losses attributed to lower sales and the merger. the exchange regularly conducts reviews of market activity surrounding corporate announcements or events and has indicated that no inference of impropriety should be drawn from its inquiry. the company cooperated with this inquiry. as a matter of policy the exchange does not comment publicly on the status of its investigations. however we have not been contacted by the nyse with respect to this investigation in approximately months. if there were any formal actions taken by the nyse it would be in the form of an investigatory panel decision such decisions are publicly available. you may contact the exchange directly if you would like more information. in july the ontario securities commission commission requested information related to the trading of mcbc stock prior to april which was the date we announced our first quarter losses attributed to lower sales and the merger. the company cooperated with the inquiry. the commission has advised the company that it has closed the file on this matter without action of any kind. in early october the audit committee of the companys board of directors concluded its investigation of whether a complaint that it received in the third quarter of had any merit. the complaint related primarily to disclosure in connection with the merger exercises of stock options by molson inc. option holders before the record date for the special dividend paid to molson inc. shareholders before the merger which were disclosed in the companys report on form k dated february statements made concerning the special dividend to molson inc. shareholders and sales of the companys common stock in connection with exercise of stock options by the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer following the merger after the release of the yearend results for coors and molson inc. and after the company lifted the trading restrictions imposed before the merger. the audit committees independent counsel which was retained to assist in conducting the investigation reviewed and discussed with the staff of the sec the various findings of an approximately month long investigation conducted by the independent counsel. the audit committee determined after thoroughly reviewing the facts and in consultation with its independent counsel to conclude the investigation. in concluding the investigation the audit committee determined that the various matters referred to in the complaint were without merit. in december miller brewing company sued the company and several subsidiaries in a wisconsin federal court. miller seeks to invalidate a licensing agreement the agreement allowing molson canada the sole distribution of miller products in canada. miller also seeks damages for u.s. and canadian antitrust violations and violations of the agreements confidentiality provisions. miller also claims that the agreements purposes have been frustrated as a result of the merger. the company has filed a claim against miller and certain related entities in ontario canada seeking a declaration that the licensing agreement remains in full force and effect. we are currently in discussions with miller regarding a resolution of this dispute. there can be no assurances that we will arrive at such a resolution. in late october molson canada received a letter from fosters group limited providing twelve months notice of its intention to terminate the fosters u.s. license agreement due to the merger. the agreement provides molson canada with the right to produce fosters beer for the u.s. marketplace. in november molson canada filed a notice of action in ontario canada disputing the validity of the termination notice. in december fosters filed a separate application in ontario canada seeking termination of the agreement. molson canada will vigorously defend its rights in these matters. molson coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. the suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to children and other underage consumers. in essence each suit seeks on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians an injunction and unspecified money damages. in each suit the manufacturers have advanced motions for dismissal to the court. several of the lawsuits have been dismissed on appeal. there have been no appellate decisions. we will vigorously defend these cases and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any related to these lawsuits. cbl replaced a bonus plan in the united kingdom with a different plan under which a bonus was not paid in . a group of employees pursued a claim against cbl with respect to this issue with an employment tribunal. during the second quarter of the tribunal ruled against cbl. cbl appealed this ruling and the appeal was heard in the first quarter of where most impacts of the initial tribunal judgments were overturned. however the employment appeal tribunal remitted two specific issues back to a new employment tribunal. cbl appealed the employment appeal tribunals judgment. in january the appeal decision ruled in the companys favor holding that the employment tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the employees claims and the claims were dismissed. it is possible that the employees may attempt to advance their claims in a different forum. we are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings in our opinion based on a review with legal counsel none of these disputes and legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows. however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters including the abovedescribed advertising practices case may arise from time to time that may harm our business. insurance we are selfinsured for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of employee health insurance programs as well as workers compensation general liability automobile liability and property insurance deductibles or retentions. during we fully insured future risks for long term disability and in most states workers compensation but maintained a selfinsured position

disclosure controls and procedures our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the companys management including our global chief executive officer and global chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that by their nature can only provide reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives. also we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities that we do not control or manage. consequently our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. the global chief executive officer and the global chief financial officer with assistance from other members of management have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act as of december and based on their evaluation have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. the certifications attached as exhibits and hereto should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein. managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in the exchange act rule af. the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u. s. generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. the global chief executive officer and the global chief financial officer with assistance from other members of management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on its evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december . the companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued their report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december which appears herein. remediation of material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as previously reported in our first quarter quarterly report on form qa we had identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting with respect to accounting for income taxes which continued to exist as of december . our remediation plan included the following activities we hired additional experienced tax staff including a new vice president of tax and two additional senior level tax managers we implemented additional procedures to ensure adequate levels of review in this area and we implemented new tax provision calculation software that has improved transparency automated calculations and improved controls surrounding accounting for income taxes particularly with respect to the global tax provision preparation. as of december we completed the execution of our remediation plan evaluated and tested the effectiveness of these controls as of december and determined that the material weakness related to income tax accounting has been remediated. changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal controls over financial reporting. item b. other information none. part iii item . directors executive officers and corporate
